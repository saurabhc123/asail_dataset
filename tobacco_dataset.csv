answer,"Most of the time is spent with Philip L Morris USA, followed by UST, which would be the next largest portion, followed by John Middleton.",sno
question,"Well, we just took -- and I don't care whether we use 70 or 75 percent then. I assume by what you say that certainly second place would have over, over half of your remaining time, correct?",bin-d

And in that notice it contained a schedule, Schedule A, asking you to bring certain materials with you to the deposition. I will be the first one to concede that this is a standard schedule that is sent out for an expert witness, so much of the description would probably not be germane to you. But my question is did you look at Schedule A to the notice of your deposition and, in particular, paragraphs 1 through and including 23?",confront

question,"Well, sir, I am just going by what was disclosed to the plaintiff in this case that you would talk to the jury about. And I haven't yet gotten to Dr. Raffa's report and your observations about that. But insofar as what you would say about Philip Morris USA's net worth and total stockholders' equity, have you now discussed the subject matter that you would discuss with the jury?",bin-d
answer,"Based on the questions that you have asked, I have addressed those. And just to clarify, that the net worth for Philip Morris USA that we talked about is the net worth of the company at a point in time on a given date and that the net worth is a function of the assets of the company less its liabilities resulting in the net worth.",sno
question,Well ~,incomplete

question,"All I am basically asking, Mr. Simmons, is there anything else that you would tell this jury about that subject? I started this off asking you for your opinions on that particular subject, which was disclosed to us.",bin-d

question,"Well, no, sir, that's not the way we're going to play this. I want to hear from you what you would tell this jury, whatever it is, in connection with what was disclosed to us in the second paragraph concerning Philip Morris USA's net worth/shareholders' or, I'm sorry, stockholders' 0 equity.",wh-d
question,I'm sorry?,nu
answer,I have told you what I am prepared to testify about regarding the net worth and stockholders1 equity of Philip Morris USA.,sno
question,Are there any other concepts or anything else you would expect to explain to the jury?,bin
question,"Let's go on to the other paragraph of 0 your disclosure. And it says basically that you may talk about the appropriateness of the analysis 2 presented by Plaintiff's experts and rebut any opinions presented by Plaintiff's experts. 4 Let me see how much we can short-circuit 5 this, Mr. Simmons. I want you to assume that it was represented to me that insofar as Dr. Raffa's analysis is concerned, your testimony, your observations about that analysis would be the same as your testimony in the Whitney case, which you gave on March 7, 2013. That is assuming, of course, that Dr. Raffa's approach or methodology was the same. Was that an accurate representation?",bin-d
question,What are your observations about Dr. Raffa's report?,wh
answer,"My observations are that the numbers that he profiled in the calendar years 2009 through the first quarter of 2014 were directly taken from Altria's 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings. And, again, those numbers were prepared accurately in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. What I noticed in Dr. Raffa's report is that he aggregated full calendar years in a quarter's worth of financial information, which in my experience I have never seen that done before, to aggregate annual data and quarterly data. And then to take that data and divide it by the number of days over that aggregate period of time, so analytically I have never seen numbers presented in that fashion. And it is not something that is a generally accepted accounting requirement or principle. I notice that there were references to both Philip Morris USA and Altria in Dr. Raffa's report. To the best of my knowledge Philip Morris USA's the defendant in this case. And then as it related to income, I noticed that there were references to operating income and net earnings, and if you were trying to get at net earnings, I am not really sure why the operating income is profiled.",sno
question,Is the operating income the same thing as pre-tax data?,bin
answer,"That is correct. It is pre-tax data and there is no references to the federal and state Laxes that are paid. It just goes from operating income to net earnings. And, and the net sales, the operating income, and the net earnings, there is an aggregation of annual data and quarterly data, and then divided'by the number of days over this five-year and one-quarter's period of time. So analytically I have never seen data presented that way. And so I am not really sure what the purpose is, but those would be my observations.",y-d
question,Any other observation about Dr. Raffa's work than what you have described?,qo
answer,No.,n
question,"Any criticisms, any other criticisms of Dr. Raffa's work and report?",bin
answer,No.,n
question,"Well, this probably took less time. I had the court reporter sent your testimony in the Whitney case, and I was just going to refer you to the page where you describe it, but I think you are very consistent using perhaps a different word here or there. Okay. Let's move on and see if we can get this wrapped up.",sno

question,"Now, is it your testimony that you would 3 have to do this evaluation you speak of if there 4 were an award of 1 million dollars in punitive 5 damages?",bin-d
answer,"We would go through the process. Certainly a smaller amount in the scenario that you just referenced would require 'less analysis, but we still would go through a process to do the evaluation.",sno
question,"All right. You would go through the process. I understand that. That's basically just a business function, is it not?",bin-d
question,"While you would go through that process for an award of a million dollars, as you sit there under oath you really would have no hesitation or doubt but that the company had the ability to pay a million dollars without going out of business, right?",bin-d
question,"But my question was you really wouldn't have any doubt, knowing the finances of Philip Morris USA as you do, as the top person at Philip Morris USA when it comes to finances, you wouldn't have any doubt in your mind even before going through that analysis that Philip Morris USA could pay one million dollars, would you?",bin-d
question,"Now, Mr. Simmons, with all due respect, that wasn't my question. My question is an award of a million dollars would not cause you to have any doubt that Philip Morris USA could pay that amount of money without it impacting Philip Morris to such an extent that it would go out of business, would you?",bin-d

There is the profit and loss or the income statement, which determines the net income of the company, which is the function of looking at revenues minus expenses over an historical period of time. And the statement of cash flows and the income statement, they together feed into the balance sheet of the company, which gives you the net worth of the company at a point in time.

What are a company's assets, generally 5 speaking?",sno
question,Are the assets on Philip Morris USA's balance sheet all assets or things that the company owns that can easily be converted to cash?,bin

answer,Yes.,y
question,What are they?,wh
answer,"There is a wine company, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates. And then there is a leasing company, Philip Morris Capital Corporation.",sno
question,"All right. What does Ste. Michelle Wine Company contribute to, to Altria Group --",wh
question,"percentage-wise, just like you gave me the estimate for U.S. Smokeless Tobacco.",sno
answer,"Again, I don't know the exact number, but what I would tell you is that it is less than 5 percent.",dno
question,And the leasing company?,bin
answer,"And that I can't answer for you today. I don't think it is very big, but I can't even give you an approximate right now. I don't have responsibility for that business.",dno
question,"Sure, I understand. And that's fair. But when you say ""not very big,"" are we in the 1 to 2 percent ballpark?",bin-d
answer,I am going to tell you that it is less than 10 percent.,sno
question,"Okay. Okay. Fair enough. So just 4 thinking over the percentages you have given me, would it be a decent approximation that Philip Morris USA, Inc. provides, I don't know, 65, percent minimum of the, of Altria Group's earnings?",bin-d
answer,"To use your numbers at a minimum, yes.",y-d
question,"And I mean it may be a bit higher too, right?",bin-d
answer,"Depending on the period, yes.",y
question,"And that contribution of Philip Morris USA, Inc. is predominantly due to the sale of cigarettes, correct?",bin-d

question,"Good morning. Thank you for your cooperation in appearing remotely with me by Skype connection. My name is Philip Gerson.: I don't know, if we've ever met, but I have seen you in the past and seen you testify in the past. .

question,For how long?,wh
answer,For about 5 years since 1999.,sno
question,"Okay. Now you have given many, many depositions in lawsuits against Reynolds where smokers or their survivors have, sued Reynolds for personal injury, sort of wrongful death allegedly caused by smoking cigarettes made by Reynolds; is that correct?",bin-d
answer,"I've testified in many cases with regard to the Engle project cases, yes.",y-d
question,And you know how many?,wh
answer,I believe I have testified in over 33 trials and have given many more than that depositions.,sno
question,Something on the order of 65 or 70 depositions?,bin
answer,"Probably, yeah.",y
question,"And you've given those depositions, have you not, in, in various capacities related to specific technical topics and also as the corporate representative of R... J. Reynolds or RAl; isn' t that correct?",bin-d
answer,"I have mostly been an expert and fact witness relying on my scientific expertise. I have occasionally given corporate rep depositions, but they would be. in the far minority compared to expert and fact testimony.",sno
question,"/ So 3'5 trials and 65 or 70 depositions. How would you generally describe the subject matter, subject matters you've been questioned about?",wh-d
answer,"Most of my testimony is, is based and relies oh my .scientific expertise around cigarette design, scientific issues related to tobacco and tobacco smoke.. That's, that's really what I'm an expert in. I certainly, can --. I have and do talk about where the company, what the company is doing currently, its current strategies, the types of products it develops. I. think it's pretty well laid out in my disclosure the topics that I have historically covered and can cover for .you todayy So I think it's pretty clear.",sno
question,". In, in preparing for the depositions that- you've given in the smokers cases, is it true that you spent about a year reviewing company documents concerning the history of Reynolds --",incomplete

question,Can you hear me now?,bin
answer,Frozen again. .,sno
question,How about now? Can you hear me now?,wh
answer,Yes.,y
question,"Okay. I'll start over with that question and I appreciate your patience with whatever technical problems we may encounter here. My question is this: . Before you gave any of these depositions, is it true that you spent about a year reviewing documents and meeting with lawyers in order to prepare?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, with regard to the amount of time in terms of calendar, that is correct. But what I would typically do or the amount of time I spent in preparation is not here, okay. I met with lawyers for about once a week for ah hour or two to discuss historical issues with regard to tobacco litigation. I would certainly spend time reviewing documents, reviewing the history of R. J. Reynolds. So between the time I was asked if I would agree to testify and the time that I took my first or gave my first deposition, that was about a year.",sno
question,"Okay. And during that time period as you've explained, you did spend adequate time, for reading arid reviewing company documents so that you could testify as a corporate .representative for the company concerning the relationship of the company with the Tobacco Industry Research Council, the Center for Tobacco. Research, The Tobacco. Institute, for example, correct?",bin-d
answer,"When I -- to answer your question, Counselor> that is not what I prepared during:that course of time before I testified. I was, I prepared'on company history to understand the science and the science behind where the, where the company had spent its time researching tobacco and design and the development of technologies and understanding the basic scientific backdrop starting in the 1940s and '50s. With regard to corporate rep deposition for specifically Duval County, I was asked and I did agree that i would prepare.to talk about, those types of issues with regard to R. J. Reynolds involvement with the Tobacco Institute, CTR and TIRC. .and the .formation thereof. That was several years ago. .'And I did prior to that testimony which took seven days as I recall of testimony, I spent a good number of. -'-; a couple of weeks as I recall going through a. large amount of documents that Plaintiff's Counsel provided for that deposition. So that is a very different scenario than the vast majority of the time that I've testified which is as an expert which is based on my reliance as a scientist and ray understanding and experience as a cigarette product developer. So it's a little bit different case, set of circumstances with regard to that. ''""'.",sno
question,So you've testified basically in both capacities. Is that hot what you're telling me?,bin-d
answer,"I have but what I'm saying is there's a very different level of preparation for what I would consider to be a corporate rep deposition than level of preparation that I require to give testimony as a fact or an expert. Typically, the way I understand in the couple of times that I've testified as a corporate rep: is materials have been provided to me ahead of time to review and I. would, prepare as the person most knowledgeable, in those specific capacities. And that's how I have historically prepared for those types of depositions.",sno
question,"Do you recall that in addition to the reference you just made to the Duval County six or seven day deposition that in fact/ I believe in the summer of 2014, you gave a deposition as a corporate . representative that was taken by Lawyer Gary. Page?",bin-d
answer,"I believe that is correct. And again, the same type of preparation occurred where. I believe Mr. Page provided materials in advance that we would cover in that deposition. That's what"" I'm familiar with. You [, know, I bring up Duval County because it's got a lasting memory.. It lasted for seven days so it's hard for me to forget the level of preparation and the. amount of time I spent with that one.",so
question,"I understand that. And without the need of going through 65 or 70 depositions and 3 0 plus trial testimonies, I --",incomplete
answer,You froze. You got to repeat. Frozen again.,sno
question,"I just muted and then unmuted my phone. Did that, did that -- ho, my Skype. Did that help the connection?",bin
answer,"It's kind of like you freeze up.. You know, it's like the you' re j.iist frozen on the screen which just happened again so.",sno
question,". Okay. You know what? I'm going to call into trie conference call and then talk'to you over the conference call and.just mute the Skype. So we'll use the Skype so that we can see each other and we'11 fely on the conference call for the audio. Hopefully that will make this go smoother and easier, okay?",bin-d
answer,Fair enough.,sno
question,Can you hear me how?,bin
question,".. Okay. I've muted trie Skype. And hopefully, that will solve the technical problem and we can continue our discussion over the conference call. Is that working for you, Mr. Figlar?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, that's fine.",y
question,"Okay. Let me ask you this. You, you have the, the title of Doctor. You're not a medical doctor, are you?",bin-d
answer,No. PhD chemist.,n-d
question,And do you prefer to be referred to as Dr. Figlar?,bin
answer,"In this, setting, .I would prefer that, yes.",y-d
question,Okay. : .,ack
answer,"'"".. In normal life, no. But in this professional. setting, then I think it's probably best.we refer to each other.as'business titles.",n-d
question,"Okay. That's fine. I just didn't want to offend you by failing to use your title. Dr. Figlar, without going through the long list of 65 plus depositions and.36 plus trial testimonies, is it fair to say that in addition to the, the long, multi-day deposition in Duval County and the more recent deposition taken by.Mr. Page that you have both in deposition and; in courtrooms testified as a corporate representative concerning the corporate knowledge of the health risks and addictive nature of smoking and the history of: the product design by Reynolds Tobacco Company?",qo
answer,"In, in court, I'm not sure about. Certainly, in, in deposition I have on occasion had served in Capacity ^s a corporate representative for RJR Tobacco on a.variety of those types of issues.",dno
question,"Okay.. .And you have, you know that you've been designated from R, J. Reynolds as the person from that company with the most knowledge on the topics of the corporate relationship between Reynolds and the TIRC, 'the- CTR and the TI,'correct?",bin-d
answer,"I know I have in the past and again, specifically as it applies to Duval County, I know for sure that was the case-.",sno
question,"Okay. I'd like to talk to you for a while now about some of, some of that history.. No doubt both as a scientist and as a prior corporate representative witness, you have'been questioned about-the earliest scientific reports of a potential link between cigarette smoking and cancer back in the 1950s. Is that.a fair statement,' sir?",bin
answer,"I am certainly familiar with the scientific history so, yeah. If you want me to talk about specific articles or papers or literature, I'll do my best to answer your gu.estions.",sno
question,". Okay. Prior to the mouse painting study by Winder and Graham that came out in December of 1953, was it Reynolds Tobacco Company's belief or opinion that the use of its products by smokers caused cancer?",bin-d
answer,". I wouldn,'t characterize their position as being that- I think their position was they I don't know that they necessarily held a position on that prior to say. 1953, '54 in terms of a public position. So I don't, know.:. I mean, prior to ,the Frank Statement, . I: don't know that they would have had a, a strong position one way or another.",sno
question,"Would it be fair to say that so far as you know,."" they didn't know one way or the other?. MR, LATHAM: Objection to form.",bin-d
answer,"I wouldn't say they wouldn't know. I think, I think I would characterize it as certainly the people that were in charge of the company, R. J. Reynolds and other companies, Were certainly aware of certainly the, at least some of the science and the accusations around cigarettes.. I mean/ it had been talked about . for a long period of time. Certainly, I mean, going back decades, if not centuries, in terms', of accusations around smoking. But. I think, you know/ starting in the, in the, in the early 1950s is when a lot of/ much more strong'science particularly . epidemiology and as you mentioned mouse skin painting really started to. surface at that time.",sno
question,"So in the, in the '40s and before the mouse painting study and the epidemiology came.out, Reynolds didn't have a corporate belief or conviction that smoking cigarettes was the cause of any kind of cancer, did it?",bin-d
answer,"I wouldn't say that they would have at that time, no. .",n-d
question,Okay. Did they think that it was harmful in any way?,bin
answer,"You know, I don't know prior to, prior to as I said before:the Frank Statement,. I'm not, I'm not sure, what types of corporate position's they would have had. You know., that's going back what, over 60, 70 years. At this point, we're talking almpst 100 years.worth o f . history. R. J, Reynolds was founded in 1875. So you're talking about a pretty old company.",dno
question,"Weil,. I Understand that, . of course'. And what I'm getting at is simply R;. J. Reynolds in the '40s and even through the '50s would not have advertised its cigarettes with nationally popular athletes and entertainers if it believed that the.cigarettes were harmful, would it?",bin-d
answer,"I don't know. You. know, I'm not.a marketing expert. I have some understanding of what our corporate marketing policies, have been over the years, but I'm not, I'm not a marketing guy.",dno
question,"Well, I'm not asking you. for a. marketing opinion. I'm just asking'you if the, if the company would have with.knowledge, that its product was harmful promoted it with the kinds of advertising that- I know that you're familiar with that was commonly.used: in the 1940s and the 1950s?.",qo
answer,"Again, I don't know what the, what the rationale would have been, I'm riot, I'm not a marketing expert.",dno
question,"Well, I'm not asking you about the marketing because we know what the marketing was: What I'm. asking yOu is what Reynolds knew or believed at.the time, about the potential, harms Of its products, if any?",wh-d
answer,I --. . .,incomplete
question,"Well, so far as you know, go ahead. You can answer it to the extent you can.",sno
answer,"I mean, I think I've, I think I've expressed to you the corporate position as I understand what the . Frank- Statement was is that at that time, the companies did not believe that their product was injurious to health. I believe I've seen the Frank Statement enough times, I have significant reasons to believe based on the information, that I've read, in the past that the people believed that that was a true statement.. ""'",sno
question,"Okay. I have.the Frank Statement marked as an exhibit and I'm happy to show it to you if you would like to.see it. It's Exhibit 19, but I think based on your, your last statement that you're sufficiently familiar with it so that I'm ready to just go forward with some questions. If you want to see it though, please ask, okay?.",bin-d
answer,"Well, I would prefer to have it in front of me.",sno
question,"Okay, ail right.",ack
answer,Okay.,ack
question,"So just tell me .what your, from your own knowledge and your own research and investigation you understand the purpose of the. Frank Statement to be?",wh
answer,"Well, I think the purpose of the Frank Statement was the companies had got together after a . variety of reports were showing up in both the popular press as well as the scientific'press to talk about what, what they felt the state of the science, was. Because at that time while there were the mouse.skin painting results that had come out and the first epidemiology had come out, there were a number of scientific authorities that didn't necessarily think that the case.was, was shut in terms of relationship between smoking, and health. ; The other purpose -- so they wanted to say what their, what the, the Frank. Statement is really talking about what they feel the current state of knowledge is. But the other purpose of the Frank Statement was to announce the formation of the Tobacco Institute Research Council, excuse me, the Tobacco Industry Research Council where the companies had pledged to spend a significant amount of money in research to .try to make a firm determination on smoking and health-related issues and that's the other part of this advertisement that ran in a.number of newspapers.-",sno
question,"So is it a fair reading of the:Frank Statement to say that, that Reynolds and the other companies that joined in it said that there was. no proof that cigarette snicking was a cause of lung cancer?.",bin
answer,"They, they use that terminology in here. Of course, what- they're meaning is there's not adequate scientific proof to establish that causal link. And indeed at that time in the/ in the early to mid-1950s, the convention in terms of understanding'causal relationships especially for chronic diseases, a ""number of lines of evidence were.required to point to that and they.had not been at that point fulfilled. So I think that was a fair statement at that time.",sno
question,"And together with the other companies that joined in the Frank Statement, Reynolds did not believe that the products they made were injurious to health in general, correct?",bin-d
answer,"They did state that. They stated that belief that at that time they believed that their products were not injurious to health. That, is correct.",bin-d
question,"And so. far as you know, was that true at the time they said it?",bin
answer,"Well, I mean, with the, with the benefit of looking back in history, I would not agree with that. But I think at that time, they certainly believed that and the amount of science that was available in terms of providing that a surety of evidence, I think they believed it and I think they had good reason to believe that.",sno
question,And do you think that they had the same belief about laryngeal cancer and emphysema even though those exact diseases were not mentioned expressly in the Prank Statement?,bin-d
answer,"I would, I would think that's a fair assessment, yes.",y-d
question,"And so what they were then promising the, the public was that they would create the Tobacco Industry Research Committee and commit research dollars to try and get to the bottom of it and learn more and try.and find out definitively if their products were.injurious tp health. Is that a fair characterization of what the pledge-was at the time?",bin-d
question,"Okay./ And together with, with Reynolds/they were joined by,' as. the Frank Statement.itself says,, they were joined by the chief executives of 8 or other tobacco companies that were the most prominent in the industry at the time; is that correct?",bin-d
answer,"Well, you had tobacco companies. You had Bright Belt Warehouse Association.- You had Growers Associations. You had, you know, both smokeless and cigarette, tobacco companies. So it was a, you know, fairly long list of most folks who were in the tobacco industry at that, time but not just cigarette companies.",sno
question,"'.- But including all the cigarette companies . except fori Liggett and Meyers-, correct?",bin-d
answer,.1 don't --'-.,incomplete
question,"Okay. And Lorillard Tobacco Company also became part of Reynolds recently, did it not?",bin-d
answer,"Just last year, yes.",y-d
question,".. And Benson and Hedges became part of Philip Morris, did it not?",bin-d
answer,"I presume so because Benson and Hedges, the cigarette brand, is mahufactured by Philip Morris. I believe I know that..",sno
question,"Okay. So to carry out the, the pledge of the Frank Statement, what did the Tobacco Industry Research Committee begin doing in 1990 - in 1954 and moving forward through that decade?",wh
answer,"Arid again, I would say, you know, this is going to be based on memory since/ really since Duval County- So that we're talking three or.four years ago. But, you know, as I recall, the companies committed to put forward the TI-RG and the, one of the functions was going to be a grant and aid kind of committee to study issues related to tobacco use and particularly smoking and health-related issues. So they, they all, all the companies basically pledged money and research was conducted. As I recall, hundreds of millions of dollars of research was conducted by the, by the- TIRC later to'be CTR to a variety of institutions and professors and well known scientists and lots of peer.reviewed.articles appeared and it studied a whole variety of subjects. ""A lot of time spent looking at mechanistically how is cancer formed because that was one of,the,.kind of one of the lynch pins in terms of cause and effect but a variety of things. Animal.models were or tried to be developed, another lynch pin. -So a lot of time, money and effort was spent in research that was funded through TIRG later CTR.",sno
question,"You referenced later CTR and just -- I think you and I both know what that acronym stands for. But in.case there are others that don't,: it's true, is it nof, that the Tobacco Industry Research Committee or TIRC later branched off into two other organizations, one called the CTR, the Center for Tobacco Research, arid the other called the TI or. The Tobacco Institute, Correct? A- That is correct, yes.",bin-d
question,"And the, the membership included Reynolds all the way through until those organizations were disbanded around the year 2000. is that also correct? ...A It. was .199-8. as I recall,''but I. believe that is correct. R. J. Reynolds was a member throughout that timeframe.",bin-d
question,"And so were the other companies that R. J.. Reynolds acquired prior to the time that R.' J. Reynolds acquired them, correct?",bin-d
answer,"I don't know that that's true, I thought perhaps- American Tobacco Company did hot participate for some period of time or for some years. Again> I would have to prepare and look back to know all that tenure. I can tell you about Reynolds - That would, be correct",dno
question,": Okay. And so -- MR, LATHAM: Mr. Gerson, Mr. Gerson, I need- to take a, I need to take a. short break and call Frank Baek because apparently you just served a deposition notice.within the last few minutes, at least the filing date is 10:52 a.m., suggesting . that this deposition is taken pursuant to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure .1.310 B-6. We do. object to that and I want to call Mir.. Baek and talk, about what he wants to do given this recent event that just happened a minute ago. So let's take a break so I can do that.",sno
question,"Okay. Mr. Figlar, Dr. Figlar, I apologize to you for all that lawyer banter, but we're ready to, to go forward now. Would it have been Reynolds' policy historically to-, have admitted publicly-that its products were causing laryngeal cancer or other morbid diseases if it believed that was true?",or
answer,I don't know if they would have had a policy on. that or not. .,dno
question,"Well, what, what's your feeling on that? What's,your, what would your personal policy be on that? If a company knows that its products are . causing a disease, should it admit that publicly?",wh
answer,"I mean, are you asking me as. a -- I'm not quite sure I -- are you asking me my personal opinion?.",confront
question,"Yeah. I'm asking your view,, your view. I mean, and in the capacity In which you are here as' an officer of the Defendant..",y-d
answer,"You know, my personal opinion would be I would think that if a, if a company knows that it has or if a company knows it has a product thatTs dangerous, then I think they have some responsibility to, to inform people of that. I don't think it's unreasonable for corporations to have that either. That's my personal, opinion.",sno
question,"And so in the.1950s starting with the, the Frank Statement that you've made reference to before, was Reynolds merely telling the public that it didn't know whether its product or .so far as it knew, its product was not the cause of any disease but that it together- with other tobacco, compani.es was going to. try and fund, research, to find out?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, I think that the .the scientific situation in the '50s is pretty clear. I think that the tobacco companies had a very similar view as the National Cancer Institute had at that time. National Cancer Institute/ I'm sure you're aware, did not believe that, that cigarette smoking could, be linked causally to cancer. In fact, T think at various points in time,- they even questioned whether or not the epidemiology was solid enough to say there was a statistical association. Later in the '50s, that, that was cleared up. I think it's fair to .say that at that time in the 1950s,, it was hot --- the science was not that compelling for people to say for sure that there was a strong.either A, association or B, a causal relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. There were a lot of questions at that time.",sno
question,"Okay. And between this point in time, 1953, and the year 2GOO, was Reynolds studying the, the suggestion that cigarette smoking was a cause of cancer?",bin-d
answer,"Well, I mean, I don't -- I think what Reynolds did is spent ah awful lot of time-working on product alterations with that operating premise in mind. The variety, the- variety of- things that had occurred' between the 1950s and the year 2000, a -whole variety of technologies were developed which, you know.., in their implementation would in theory follow what public health advice would have been around.trying to deal with that public health issue. Whether it was lowering, lowering tar and nicotine yields, coming up with different filtration technologies or developing something that we, that Ri J. Reynolds developed called Premier which is a heat mount burn product. So I think to answer your guestion, it would be yes. They spent a good deal of time on a product, from a product design perspective using that as an operating premise.",dno
question,"Using what as ah operating premise? State the premise, please.",wh
answer,"The operating premise was that whether or not - you could definitively provide a cause and effect relationship to say cigarette smoking and lung cancer, what'you could -- what you could presume is that if it's true, what should you do to the product to try to alleviate that. And.that is what Reynolds- did is while they did not necessarily agree that there was enough evidence to scientifically establish cause and effect relationship that did hot stop them from significantly altering the product in such a way- as to ameliorate that potential problem.",sno
question,"Well, was there some point in history between the early '50s and now when Reynolds accepted the fact that there was a causal link between cigarette smoking and laryngeal cancer?",bin
answer,"I mean, I, I think certainly in 2000, R. J. Reynolds was much more firm in the language that it used to communicate its-position oh smoking and health. It was certainly less ambiguous, less scientific in. the way it was trying to describe its position. Prior to that,. R. J. Reynolds, and other companies would have relied on a much more, I think I've said before, more egg-headed, kind of scientific description of what they believed the state of the science' was. Using terms like possible risk factor or major risk factor in the development of such and such disease for certain individuals. There were very kind of prescriptive in terras of what they believe the science justified. I think in my opinion that position, that company.position was not well understood and certainly misinterpreted, excuse me, misinterpreted..",sno
question,"Misinterpreted by whom? A'.;.. By a variety of .-- certainly folks like yourself, but potentially folks in.public health as well. '.",wh
question,"So in, in the 1950 -- in the later part of the 1950s after, the TIRC had been operating for a few years, did, did its public disclosures admit that there.was any convincirig evidence that cigarette smoke was causing diseases?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, I think my, my, my memory or my recollection of this timeframe is certainly very few. either scientific bodies or public health officials in the 1950s would, would have definitively said that there was a firm cause and effect relationship. I know there was a few but a number of people would not have, have gone that far in making that assessment. I think the, that assessment was made certainly for men in 1964 with the Surgeon General's report but not prior to'that.",sno
question,"Well, what -- I'm sorry. Have you finished?",bin
answer,I did. I'm sorry if I kind of rambled on there a. bit,y-d
question,"Didn't, didn't the TIRC in the late '50s,.; 1958 in particular, argue publicly that.there was no proof that cigarette smoking was the cause of any disease?",bin-d
answer,"My again., my memory with regard to these issues would be their, their position would, be through the * 50s that they would recognize that' there was a statistical association, i.e.., the epidemiology. They would have recognized because by the late 1950s, I believe a humbef of people were able to replicate the mouse skin painting results although it took some time before that could happen.. That they would have said there's not an explanation as to why that is the case. So therefore, cause and effect had not been established because you can't make a leap of faith to say that mouse skin is the same as human lung for lung cancer reasons and that statistics, never proved.cause and effect. So that would have been their position. So there, there was a lack of evidence in that timeframe and that would have been their position as I recall it. .",sno
question,". Didn't, didn't the TIRC say in 1958 in its. tobacco and health publication--that' there were statistics that actually contradicted the claim that . cigarette smoking was harmful?",bin-d
answer,"I don't know. As I sit here, I don't recall that.-",dno
question,Okay.,ack

question,Okay. Okay. Are you familiar with any of the Reader's Digest articles which claimed in general that cigarette smoking was a cause of cancer pi otherwise harmful to health?,bin
answer,"I remember reading a number of Reader's Digest articles but if you're going ask me to try to regurgitate that information that I have not looked at in maybe four years or so, it's going to be difficult.",sno
question,Do you know who JameS P. Richards was?.,bin
answer,Not as I sit here.,n
question,"If I refresh your recollection, would you agree that he was the president of The Tobacco Institute in the, in 1958 and other years too but at least during .-1958?",bin-d
answer,"I just, I just don't remember the name. Did the president .of The. Tobacco Institute ever publicly criticize the Feeder's Digest saying that its articles about cigarettes were unfair to cigarette manufacturers?",confront
question,Okay.,ack

Our position was and Is based on the fact that scientific evidence does hot support the theory that there is anything..in cigarette smoke known to cause human lung cancer."" The quote, ""The implications of this piece,"" unquote Mr. Richards said are quote ""most unfair to the.tobacco industry and to the general public."" Do you agree assuming that Mr. Richards was the president of the Tobacco Industry-that he is calling the Reader's Digest article Unfair to the .industry and the public?",bin-d
question,"Would you answer the question, Dr. Figlar?",bin
answer,"I would say that's what, that's what you just read that came from this, article.",sno
question,"That did reflect the, the view of Reynolds Tobacco Company at the time, did it not? MR, LATHAM: Objection to the question.",bin-d
answer,"I don't know whether of not R... J1. Reynolds felt . that a Reader's Digest article was unfair or not. But their -- their, their opinion and their position with regard to.the scientific evidence hot supporting the theory that between a cause and effect relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer would be pretty consistent. Okay... . ' At that time. Okay. Who was Clarence Cook Little? I think-- I get confused with softie of the. names. It's a name I recall;. Either it was the first person to be in charge of the TIRC or maybe in charge of BAT or I can't remember now.",dno
question,. Let me represent to you that- he was the. scientific director of the Tobacco Institute Research Committee.,sno
answer,Okay.,ack
question,". And speaking on behalf of all of its members, do you agree that the industry felt that it was scientifically unwise, in fact, possibly harmful to attribute a definitive causal role to.cigarette smoking and diseases like lung cancer?",bin-d
question,You Can answer the guestion.,sno
answer,"The ,.-- I'm finding it -- can you repeat the question? Can you just read back the question, please? So I can refresh it in my head.",confront
question,"So as I understand your, your answer, you, you agree that the TIRC was saying that science didn't know enough yet to make a judgment and you're, you're buttressing that by saying the American Cancer Society spokesperson you identified actually felt the same Way, that it could be harmful to do that so that we didn't know enough to tell people don't smoke because it's going to be that's the cause of cancer?",bin-d
answer,No.,n
question,"Well, actually the references that I was making was, were from the. early '6 0s. not the '50s, but I get the point and I don't think that you're really quibbling about the difference in the dates from '63 to some, date in the .'50s, right?",bin-d
answer,"Not too much although I, I -- no, not really.",n-d
question,And so you think there's some analogy then between the. two. . Is that really what you're saying to me?,bin-d
answer,"From a social and scientific situation, yes,, I am saying that there- is some analogy there -,. yes. It's not a one to one, but.it is, there is some . . relationship there-.",y-d
question,"And from a, view.of the public.of what the medical and scientific community is telling them to do or not to do, there is likewise some analogy?",bin-d
answer,"Well,. I'm saying that there is, that there is. certainly scientific debate, right. So there's certain perfectly valid scientific views on, on several sides of this and different bodies saying different things as to when women should go in to get screened. I just, like I said, I'm commenting on a hews story I watched last night and it was brought up again. I've been, we've been talking about age of screening certainly on the hews for the better part of. a couple of years now and maybe it has something to do with who's going to pay for those screenings. I don't know. But there's probably a host of issues at play. ' It's certainly a complicated scenario.",sno
question,"In the later '60s after the Surgeon General's report of 1964 had been released, did the, did the Tobacco Institute acting on behalf of Reynolds and others acknowledge that cigarette smoking was a cause of any kind of cancer?",bin
answer,"Specifically no,, not iri those, in those words. They would've said that there was not enough scientific evidence to establish cause and effect. The, the statistical association would have been recognized and had been recognized for a good deal of time. But that they, they would have said things that they don't know. No one knows what the causes of these .diseases are. We don11 know what *s in cigarette smoke that would cause these types of diseases. Those are the general positions that they would have, that they would have had at that time.",n-d
question,"And of course, ordinary consumers who are smokers would have not been receiving, you know, a clear directive that was of the unanimous point of view at that point in time, would they?",bin-d
answer,"Well, they would have from the public health department. I think there was only the American Medical Association,. I think, at that time that was one. of the few groups that wasn't completely convinced with regard to a cause and effect relationship. That may have been due to the fact that a. lot of clinicians .would have been involved with them, but. I, I, you . 3 know, from a, from a tobacco perspective/that was the tobacco, industry's perspective is that there wasn't enough information. But from a public health . perspective, I think there was a, there was a pretty clear at least messaging around the danger. Certainly there were warnings on the packs in ^66, et cetera.",sno
question,"Well, why did the tobacco industry disagree. with the public health community?",wh
answer,"I. think it would have, it certainly formed the basis by which The Tobacco institutewould say that, that there was not enough scientific evidence. Now I don't ever recall, as I sit here, The Tobacco Institute ever encouraging smokers to smoke. That part I don't ever remember hearing.",sno
question,"Well, did Reynolds encourage smokers to continue to smoke through advertising and through other public statements? We.'re talking about this post-1964 period of the 1960s right now.",bin-d
answer,"Okay. I don't know if- I would use those terms; I mean, R. J, Reynolds was a cigarette tobacco manufacturer. They certainly advertised like every other company that was in business selling a legal product and advertised.in the venues they'felt were appropriate for their product. And all through the course of.their history based on just my understanding and my knowledge that, they followed the rules that were required of them, either placed on them by the Federal or State governments or Other agreements that were made. So I don't think they necessarily encouraged people but they certainly advertised.",dno
question,"Well, they -- and the purpose of their advertising was to encourage people to smoke cigarettes, wasn't it?",bin-d
answer,"Again, I would characterize it as for those people who made the decision to smoke, we certainly wanted their business would be the way that I. would characterize it. So if you're.a smoker, you should consider/ you know, one of Reynolds brands.",sno
question,"Okay. And this is - Reynolds knew what the public health community was saying, but it was standing, on the things you pointed out in your previous answer as being an excuse for not admitting that smoking caused these diseases. Isn't that true, Dr. Figlar?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, I would, not view, it as an excuse. I mean, those are not valid things to want to have. answers to. Certainly, that was the way causeand' effect relationships were established prior to '64 and let's be. fair. What --the Surgeon General was very clear in the '64 Surgeon General's report that there were, that there were lines of evidence that were not available but what the Surgeon General was, was concerned about is that the weight of the public health problem justified making the statements that, that they made, at that time so that the public health community could take action. You know, again, I've read that report, you know, a number of times. So I do recall, some of those things. It was a, it was a different stance that public health and certainly, the Surgeon General took in .'64 than had been taken in the decades preceding that. That doesn't mean that animal .models aren't important or. that, causative agents aren't important but the Surgeon General's position was slightly different.",sno
question,"Okay. Dr. Figlar, have you seen this press. release before from The Tobacco Institute?",bin
answer,"I could have. It doesn't,, you know, strike a memory for me, but I could have seen it... It looks like a Tobacco Institute document or press release.",dno
question,"Okay. If you'11 hot ice on the left-hand, side, '."" it's dated December 1st, 1970?",bin-d
answer,"Yeah. I'm afraid I don't see a date but I'll -- I see them talking about November 1970 in the, in the text so and I didn't see anything more recent than that. So I could -- it's reasonable to guess that it. was that. It's the date is not on here.",sno
question,"Okay. And the title of the document is After . Millions of Dollars and Over 20 Years of Research The Question about Smoking and Health is Still a Question.. Do. you agree that that was. an honest statement at the time, December 1970?",bin-d
answer,"Yeah, it's clearly cut off. All that/all that's showing on the document is The, Question of . about Smoking and Health is Still a Question.. .",y-d
question,"Okay. Then let me. just limit my question to that part of it. Do you agree that, do you believe that that is an honest statement?",bin-d
answer,"I certainly believe that the Tobacco Institute and the tobacco companies at that time in 1970 would have said that there was not enough scientific information to provide cause and effect for all the reasons that I described in the. earlier questions^ Those, those questions and those deficiencies were not resolved at that time.",sno
question,"And does the copy that you're looking at have the.language atthe bottom of the.first column saying that, ""In the interest, of absolute objectivity/ the tobacco, industry has supported totally independent research efforts with completely nonrestrictive funding""?",bin-d
answer,"It.does read that, yes.",y
question,"And then it goes on to describe the creation of the CTR in 1954 that we discussed, correct?",bin-d
answer,It says that in the next paragraph.,sno
question,"And then it goes on in the body of the middle column and says that, As of November 1970, the CTR had awarded 396 separate grants and i89 medical schools, correct?",bin-d
answer,It says that. That's correct.,y
question,"And then in the last, column on the right in a little box, it says, ""These facts and statements are presented by the Tobacco Institute in the belief that many controversial questions concerning smoking and health must ultimately be answered by further scientific research and new knowledge and that full, free and informed public discussion is essential in the public interest.""'",bin-d
answer,"Based on what you read, I would say that's a reasonable interpretation but those are the words that kind of got cut off in that box/but I, I'm not going to argue with you there. You've -- it's got it mostly covered.",sno
question,". Okay. So would you agree reading this and looking back, over the history of the industry and your, your knowledge of it from the, the studies that you've done and the involvement you've had in all of these cases that according; to the industry there, all this research that they had funded had still hot . sufficiently documented proof that there was negative health consequences of smoking as it was still a question? '",bin
answer,Are you asking my personal opinion about what the level of proof was or what the tobacco company --,incomplete
question,"Well, I'm asking you in your you're not a man off the street. I'm asking you in your capacity as an official of RAJ and. Reynolds Tobacco Company.",bin-d
answer,"Okay, I understand.",ack
question,"Well, what would-be the point of this press release telling the public that the question about smoking and health is still a question and then discussing all of the research that had been done objectively?",wh-d
answer,"I mean, I don't know what the point is per se. I mean, you're asking me to speculate on that. It is certainly, I think reflects what the TI's position was and what the tobacco companies positions 'were. And certainly illustrates the complexity of the problem.",dno
question,So aren't you saying that the industry is telling the public in this press release that despite your personal experiences with your grandparents aside that the public should understand that they're still. questions despite lots and lots of research dollars being spent objectively about whether smoking and health -- smoking is a health problem?,bin-d
answer,"I mean, again, I think for all the reasons I illustrated before in terms of what the state of the. science and the state of the scientists who worked at.' the tobacco companies at that, time would have wanted to see with regard to establishing cause and effect relationships, those pieces of information were lacking. They continued to be lacking for many decades and. let's face it. We don't have a decent animal model today. So those were important considerations for the tobacco companies and the scientists that worked there who.helped either say that these positions are good positions to hold or not. And certainly, folks at the Tobacco Institute . was the public, arm to state what those positions were. think there were, I think one aspect in this in talking about the amount of research that had been done and the number of medical schools and hospitals that- had conducted research with the grant and aid program illustrates to some degree the complexity of the problem.. And, and I can attest as a scientist, as a PhD chemist that certainly cigarette smoking is the most eomplicated. thing I have ever tried to look at in my scientific career. So I think as a complex issue with a, with a myriad of troubles and I think what this document is trying, to. do is say that it's complicated.. They're still questions and they haven't been, solved.",sno
question,"And by the public arm, you mean that this is the vehicle by which they are speaking to the public?.",bin
answer,". I mean, The Tobacco Institute was the trade organization for the Tobacco Company so, yes. That is my understanding.",y-d
question,Okay.,ack
question,"Okay. Dr. Figlar, Exhibit 26 which also has PT humber 2602 On it is a report from The Tobacco Institute dated January 10th, 1979 titled Smoking and Health, 1964 to 1979, The Continuing Controversy. And this is not the whole report, but just a few pages of it.'. It's quite, a lengthy document in total. Are you familiar with this?",bin-d
answer,"Not off, not particularly though I'm -.- I may have seen it before but not. as I'm sitting here do I recall reviewing it.",n-d
question,"1964 is the. date of.course, of the first Surgeon General's report and 1979 is apparently the current date when this document was produced. Do you agree with that?",bin-d
answer,"The title page.is dated January the 10th, 1979. I would agree that '64 was a Surgeon General's report, first one on smoking and health.",sno
question,"Okay. So the title of the document, The Continuing Controversy, is spanning a 15-year period beginning with the-release of the first Surgeon General's report on smoking and cancer, correct?",bin-d
answer,"..Smoking and health but, yes..",y-d
question,And have you had a chance to look at the preface?,bin
answer,"I haven't but if you'd like me to, I will.",n
question,"Okay. This is the, the. president, of the .4 Tobacco Institute; Horace Kornegay, who signed this document in 1979. Do you recognize that?",bin-d
answer,"I can see it right here on the, on this page if this is an authentic document. That's what it says.",sno
question,". Well, if this was not intended to rebut the. upcoming 197-9 report of the Surgeon General, what 2,.' other function could a document such as this have had?",wh-d
answer,"I mean, I don't know. I don't know particularly what purpose other than stating what The tobacco Institute and the tobacco company's position - 9 were on these, issues that this, served. I don't know any other purpose than saying this is what their positions were. 12. Q So the public position then of the Tobacco Institute and through it Reynolds was that there was a continuing health, a continuing controversy about smoking and health as of January 1979?",dno
question,Well; do you know Of any Other public position that Reynolds took at or near this date iri time that was different from what the tobacco industry was saying?,bin
question,"And you don't know of any other public 7 disclosure that Reynolds made in 1978, 1979 or that would be different from what The Tobacco Institute is saying here, that there is still a continuing controversy over smoking and health, correct?",bin-d
answer,"As my memory serves and in that timeframe, I don't recall really any public statements that Reynolds would have made in particular.",dno
question,Reynolds oniy spoke during that timeframe through the tobacco industry and The Tobacco; Institute and the CTR?.,bin-d
answer,"In, in, on these particular issues, I would say in general, that is probably the case.",sno
question,"Okay. And so far as you know, Reynolds was being completely honest and completely forthright in supporting these public statements of The Tobacco Institute, was it not? .",bin-d
answer,"I believe certainly that ..they were, that they believed these statements.that were being made by The Tobacco Institute, yes. . And I believe .their scientists also would have supported these, types of: assertions at that time.",y-d
question,"Had they not, they never would have approved of this being released to or distributed among the public. Don't you agree?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, I can't say. That's a hypothetical. I don't know the answer to because that wasn't a situation that occurred. My understanding and based on what I've read and seen and talked to folks about are these, these positions were held for the scientific reasons that I discussed in.some degree, of detail with you earlier. I can go into them again if you .would like.",dno
answer,Thank you.,ack
question,"Now as of, as of 1980, did Reynolds believe that nicotine in cigarettes was addictive?",bin
answer,"I, I do not believe that would have been their position, no.",n
question,Is there a difference between what they believed and what their position would have been?,bin
answer,"No, there is not. That was not their position nor that is, that is they didn't believe it was addictive at that time either. They basically formed their opinions around addiction, I say would have been consistent in 1980 with the Surgeon General's view at that time.",n-d
question,And what was the Surgeon General's view at that time concerning whether or not nicotine in cigarettes was addictive?,wh
answer,"Well, that, that position was the same,,had been the same since 1964, that, that cigarettes, that nicotine and cigarette smoking particularly nicotine was a drug of habituation and not a drug of addictibh. That definition held for really from.'64 till when that, when the criteria by which one makes those judgments was altered and changed. But that's what the Surgeon General's position was on nicotine and I think that was consistent.",sno
question,"Has Reynolds shared that, Reynolds shared.that position and did not disagree with, disagree publicly with what the Surgeon General was saying about it being merely habituating and hot addictive: in the ' sense that the Surgeon General later said it was?",bin
answer,"Nor have I seen, scientific documentation that wOuld suggest otherwise. ... In fact, I think there's very little that I .saw in the scientific record discussing this issue, until, later in the 1980s and really then"" after the, after the definition was changed. So, I. see very little; discussion, about addiction at aii in the scientifie record.",n-d
question,"Okay\ Dr.. Figlar, would you agree that this, this document written by the president of the Tobacco Institute, Mr. Kornegay, is in general saying that there is still, a controversy over whether cigarette smoking is a cause of, of disease and that more research.is needed to reach a definitive conclusion?",bin
answer,"Are you asking me to read the document, sir? Because I don't know that Kornegay wrote this. I see Kornegay signed the. introduction, but you've given me, I don't know, maybe 2 0 pages, of a Tobacco Institute document that I don't know if I've read or not before and it quotes an awful lot of research. There's a pretty long. appendix.. So I don't know who wrote the document.",confront
question,"Well, you will agree with me that kornegay sighed the introduction page?",bin
answer,"Correct. But you asked me if he, that if he wrote the document. I don't know that.- He ?-",y-followup
question,.Okay.,ack
answer,"He signed the introduction page. I agree. I pointed that out, to you.",sno
question,". And he's.referencing in the introductioh proposed legislation to strengthen the warning labels on cigarette packages, correct?",bin-d
answer,"I don't know. Hold on. Let me read the introduction. Are we going to, are you going to, are we going to go beyond the introduction or should T just read the whole document or do you want me to just read the introduction?",confront
answer,Okay. Then do you want to direct me to a. paragraph then of the introduction that you want me to comment on and I'll read.it quickly?,confront
question,"Well, just the very, the first paragraph of the http://read.it (James Figlar. i introduction, doesn't that conceptualize this Concerning the pending legislation to put stronger warning labels on cigarette packages and in advertisements?",bin-d
answer,".: Yeah, it says. that.",y
question,"Okay., And then the, in, in discussing the controversy, the document focuses on certain .8 categories that it- calls, for example, on page quote, ""Selective Evidence,"" page 3, ""Epidemiological Surveys,"" page 3, ""Ignored Evidence,"" and page. 4, ..'-'Animal Inhalation Studies.""",bin-d
answer,What is your question?,confront
question,"Aren't those the headings for arguments made in support of. there still being a controversy over whether cigarette smoke is harmful to health so that. more research is needed before that should be accepted? - MR. LATHAM; Objection to form. : 7A I mean, are you ask --' I don't know that I can render that conclusion necessarily by that. I. would have to read this. I agree that there are sub, those are the subheadings that you listed. Based on a quick scan of the document, I can see that there are tens of articles that are referenced in each one of these sections and when I look back which I presume to be the, the appendix, it looks to be a number of studies and articles that are referenced. Unless you want me to. read the whole thing, I 'r-- it's hard for me to talk about specifics of what's in each subsection.",bin-d
question,"Well, I just asked you generally what your sense of what The Tobacco Institute on behalf of Reynolds and others is.saying to the public?.",bin-d
question,"Well, I'm just trying to get a, a general sense of whether you are agreeing with me that this was including Reynolds^ position as of 1984?",qo
answer,"The position, I, I think I've been pretty clear. I thought I.'just, said in. the early 1980s, the position of Reynolds and the Tobacco Institute would have been because there was a lack of certain lines of evidence that a causal relation -- a pure causal .relationship would be difficult to establish, and couldn't be established without having some of those lines of evidence be clear. That was their position.",sno
answer,And sO I think I've been pretty clear about what the company's position would have been at that time.,sno
question,And that would have been based on what they believed to be true?,bin
question,Would it not?,qo
answer,"Well, I mean, there was a lack of scientific evidence so that was their opinion. You need to have that. That doesn't necessarily mean I would completely agree with that or, or,, or looking hack in our, you know, from the benefit of., you know, being 3 years in the future. But at that time, that's what they felt was necessary to make those, relationships established and it.' s hot without. scientific merit to have those things-.",so
answer,Speaking as a scientist.,sno
question,". Other than to get smokers to agree with them , .' that there was a lack of scientific merit,. can you think of any other reason.Why they would have made this public statement?",wh-d
answer,"Well, there's a whole host of reasons why:one would want to make that, potentially make that"" public statement. There could be other causes to the same diseases that are being ignored because just as Hooper said in the '50s that you're ignoring because you're just going to blame it all on cigarette smoking. That's one,: you know, pretty important reason. Another important reason is if, if one is going to suggest that the case has already been completely made and known, then maybe there's not going to be research into the areas that are lacking that certainly from a self-serving perspective of the tobacco industry would be important for them to know if they're going to make alterations to their product to try to deal with that problem. So I mean, at this point in time., all .'that the tobacco -- certainly, Reynolds had been doing is working under the operating premise of if it's bad, this is what we should do. But they didn't have the definitive proof to say take X, Y or Z out of the smoke of have ah animal model they could rely on to test alternative designs. Those things again did not exist. If, if you say the case is completely settled, does that mean that the rest of the', scientific community just says, okay. Well, forget it. We. won't investigate cigarettes, anymore and we won't try to develop the tools that will be necessary for the .. tobacco-industry or universities working on, tobacco issues that would help, help solve that issue. So there's a whole variety of reasons for that.",sno
question,"Well, did Reynolds or CTR ever find any other causes for the increase in lung cancer from the time that smoking became widely popular in the United States? .",bin
answer,"I mean, did CTR dp that specifically? That, that I don't know because I have not read all the CTR research. Certainly, there are other causes of lung Cancer. Certainly, not everyone who gets lung cancer was a smoker. There's a variety of different causes for all the chronic diseases that.,, that human beings experience. So I mean, to answer your question again, with the benefit of sitting in my current.seat of . being in the future versus being in the 1980s when these types of statements were found, yeah.. There's : lots of different causes of cancer. And there's different causes of lung cancer and there's different causes of laryngeal cancer, not just smoking. So that's, that benefit of foreknowledge is, the answer to that question is.yes. Don't know that the CTR particularly derived that, but they may have helped in the,, in the progression of the science over that timeframe to render those kinds of conclusions . .",confront
question,"Well, if Reynolds had.admitted that cigarette smoking was the cause of, primary cause of lung cancer and was a primary.cause of laryngeal cancer, is there any reason why they couldn't have continued their research to identify what the other real causes were?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, there' s -- I mean, that's like trying to prove a negative. There's no, there's no answer to that question. Of course, research could always occur. But at the end of the day in terms of how grant and aid foundations work, in terms of how monies are. distributed from the government in terms of research programs, if somebody was going to say oh, well, we have all the -- we. know all the reasons of '.' why lung cancer is caused and it all has to do with smoking, there may be funding that dries up from those sources. So that is a, that's a kind of a.political science answer to your question but it's certainly a. possibility. Doesn't mean you'couldn't still do the research but'there could be, there couldbe impact.",n-d
question,"Well, in 2015, has research into nonsmoking ; causes of lung cancer and laryngeal cancer stopped?",bin
answer,"I don't think that it's very aggressive. I think what's interesting on that topic is there is certainly a greater degree of discussion around environmental pollution causing things like esophageal, laryngeal and lung cancer than there has been since the notion was first discussed in the 1950s. So if you read some of those, a lot of the articles that were being written and certainly things that the Tobacco Institute was talking about in the 1950s, all that kind of research died down from until how where all we can talk about oh the hews is climate change. And now we're talking about environmental causes of things like lung cancer and other forms of cancer that have not been frankly researched in, to my, in my opinion in decades. Perhaps because there was so much focus on it's smoking.",sno
question,"So you think we should continue to commit our research dollars to determine whether, cigarette smoking is -a .cause of.lung cancer so that we don't. stop or inhibit other research concerning alternative etiologies or causes? . . MR. LATHAM:- Objection to form.",bin-d
answer,"No. You completely misunderstand, I think, what I was saying. I mean/ I think it's, I think it's known that cigarette smoking is a cause of lung cancer and a number of other cancers. I'm not saying that, that you need to stop necessarily that research, but I think there are impacts of where you. put focus in terms of that type of medical research. T mean, I think it's pretty well known that cigarette smoking is a cause of disease.",n-d
question,When did Reynolds admit that for the first time? . MR. LATHAM: Objection to form.,wh
answer,"Well, I mean, it depends on how you look at it, Again, with unambiguous language where those words are used unambiguously in 2000. Prior to that, in the '90s and the late '80s, Reynolds would have been, talking and certainly the Tobacco Institute would have beeh talking about risk factors or major risk factors and scientifically, I think that was what you could justifiably say. And frankly,, if you're going to be again, and I think I used the term egghead of geeky science about it, that's what the science really says. So if you read more recent Surgeon General's reports, they talk in that language. There's, there's evidence sufficient to say X, Y or Z. And, and so to answer your gazestion again, specifically in 2000 ' unambiguously, smoking is a cause of lung cancer, that type of language was used.",sno
question,But not before?,qo
answer,"I explained to you what was used before. It was scientific termihblogy talking about risk factors which is not the, not the same as being pretty hard about it... Risk factors for certain people, eh cetera, like that is a mUch more scientific definition and position.",sno
question,"So for the first time that ordinary people were told in plain and unmistakable language that cigarette smoking caused cancer, it was the year 2000? .",bin-d
answer,"No. Unambiguously, they were told in 1964 by the SUfgeon General.",n-d
question,First time that they were told by Reynolds was in 2000?,bin

question,And do you agree that the manufacturer -.should' know more about its product.than anyone else? .,bin
question,"You. don't,, you hayen^t. said in the past that the manufacturer should know more, about the way its product affects people than anyone else?",bin-d
answer,"I don't know if 1/ if I nyay have said that or not. I mean, I think it's certainly a goal. It doesn't mean that that's an absolute certainty in truth in terms of whether or not they can or do know that or have; that expertise to. make those kind of assertions or not.",dno

We.certainly stay up to date in terms of scientific literature and have an understanding and have people that have expertise in those types of areas.

answer,"I mean, in general/.I agree with you. Although, I would always concede that I could never know what any one individual may know. And you know, I mean, a patent clerk changed the world, Albert Einstein, right. So I mean, you just never know who, what people aire doing in terras of what type of research they're willing to do on their own. But in- general, I would certainly agree with that.",sno
question,".She has an elementary, she has an elementary school education, does she not?",bin-d
answer,"As I recall in the interrogatories, I believe that was mentioned. 0 And so you would agree that in terms of what R 18' J. Reynolds and the .CTR. and the TI knew about the health effects of smoking cigarettes and laryngeal cancer that the corporate entities knew exponentially more than Barbara Morales in the 1980s and the 1990s, would you not?",bin-d
question,"Well, I'm hot talking,-I'm hot asking.for ah IQ test. I'm asking about information and knowledge.",sno
answer,"Again, I mean, I presume she had a grade school education. She could read...' I don't know what: information she had or had access to. But in all likelihood, I would certainly say. that the companies probably knew more than, than Barbara Morales. It's a high likelihood.",sno
question,". And the, and hot just a little more,. exponentially more?",bin
answer,"Sir, I'm a scientist. You' re asking me to make quantitative statements. I'm just going to tell you ~- and I can't do that without data. So, you know, I'm, I'm comfortable with my answer already. That it's..very likely that, she knew less than the companies about cigarette smoking and their products.",sno
question,Okay. Are you familiar with the Surgeon General's report that came out in 1988?,bin
answer,"I am somewhat familiar, yes. I have .looked at that report before.",y-d
question,And what were the major conclusions of that report?',wh
answer,"Are you asking me to again, another memory test or.do you want me to just characterize what the, the biggest impact is?",or
question,"Well, Plaintiff's Exhibit 13 has excerpts the report.",sno
question,"I'm happy, to show it to you and it's PT and the major conclusions are set forth on page which, is 382:8-28'. It's about four pages into the exhibit. Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, sir.",y
question,"Okay.: Okay. Dr. Figlar, we now have a, a few pages of the 1988 Report of the Surgeon General on the : health consequences of smoking and the title of the report is Nicotine Addiction and I've directed you to a section that states the major conclusions, correct?",bin-d
answer,You have.,y
question,"And it says that ""Cigarettes and other forms of tobacco are addicting."" Did Reynolds admit that publicly or did OTR or TI admit that publicly before this report came out?",or
answer,". That would not have been the company's position at that time. , It would have been consistent with the 1964.Surgeon General's definition of what addiction meant and nicotine in particular and cigarettes in particular.",sno
question,"And as we mentioned.before, we're using position and beliefs interchangeable, synonymously, correct?",bin-d
answer,"In my mind, I don't think they have been separated yet.",sno
question,""" Okay. .",ack
answer,They were the same.,sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,"The company held the position because they believed that position, and they stated that positiph to the' best of their belief. That this, you know-, these conclusions and I'm. sure the company said and. had said before, this would have been inconsistent with what the Surgeon General said in '64.",sno
question,"And in the second major conclusion it says that ""Nicotine is the drug in tobacco that causes . addiction."" Had Reynolds ever believed and admitted that?",bin-d
answer,"That nicotine is a drug? I mean, they knew it's a drug. It was known as a drug of-habituation and so I mean, they would have known it was a drug. They would have again, certainly at this time, would have said why did the definition change so erratically^ So they wouldn't have agreed necessarily with this conclusion.",sno
question,"And the third major conclusion, ""The pharmacologic and behavioral processes that determine tobacco addiction aie similar to those that determine addiction to drugs such as heroin and cocaine,"" Had Reynolds ever admitted publicly that the pharmacologic process that determines tobacco addiction is similar to the process for, that determined addiction for heroin and cocaine?",bin-d
answer,"Not to my knowledge nor do I think, nor would I know, whether or not Reynolds would have necessarily known- how to do that.. They certainly studied nicotine . in the late 1980s and early '90s' and studied- some biological processes, but I don't know whether or riot they would have been or had known, that much about it at this point in.time.",dno
answer,"There would have been, there would have been research underway at that point in time in 1988 would be my guess -.-",sno
question,"Are you familiar with the, with.the Tobacco rnstitute press release May 16, 1988 identified with a man named Walker Merryman? It's Plaintiff's Exhibit 23, PT2510, but I think you might just be familiar with the document from other cases you've been involved in. It's entitled Claims that cigarettes are addictive irresponsible arid scare tactics.",bin-d
answer,"I'm not, I don't know about the document. I think I've-heard that kind of, that, type -- I've heard Plaintiff's attorneys use that terminology quite a bit but if you* re asking me to comment on a document, then I think you probably need to show me the document. I don't know off the top of my head.",dno
question,.Okay.,ack
answer,Is it one of the exhibits that you want me to look at?,bin
question,"Yes. It's Plaintiff>s Exhibit 23, PT2S10. It's a two-page document. Claims that cigarettes, are addictive Ifresponsible- scare tactics. ",y-d
answer,".And is this --and I don't know off. the top of my head because 1 haven't researched this, but I've seen these types of documents before from The Tobacco Institute. And I've.seen a number of them that you guys have presented to. me that actually didn't go out and I. don't know if this is one of those ones or not- Is that fair? You know what I ',m talking about?.",dno
question,. Yes.,y
answer,"Okay. So I don't know if this is one', of those, ones that was an early draft or if this is one of the ones that actually went, to press or not. But I believe I've seen this document before.",dno
question,"Well, what, --do you disagree that it was Reynolds' position through the TI as of May 16, that, the Surgeon General's 198 8 Report was scare tactics and that the claims that cigarettes were addictive contradict common sense?",bin-d
answer,"Again, and I don't know all the ends and puts of individual cases, but what I do know is that anything that The Tobacco Institute, actually did release would have tacitly been approved by R. J. Reynolds. I don't know that this Is one of those ones that did that... My presumption Is is that a number of draffs would have been formulated by the Institute and maybe from time to time one of the tobacco companies said, yeah. I don't like that language. You need to change it. Now I haven't seen a lot of examples of that, but I would argue that that is a possibility. Again, I don't know if this is one of the ones that was released or not. It says For Release, but I don't know that it was released and if that, language was used.",dno
question,okay --,incomplete
answer,That's all I'm trying to say. I just don't know the answer to that because-I haven't researched it and I haven't seen documents like this since the Duval County deposition which was a number of years ago.,dno
question,"Well, let's just use up the rest of the minutes that we have. If you can add a few, that might help.",sno
answer,"Unfortunately not, but I'm happy to do that.",n-d
question,"In our Exhibits 1, 2 --oh, I guess it's through about 9 of video clips from television . programs, Ted Koppel, Tobacco Institute releases from Bill Merryman. Anne Browder a spokesperson for The Tobacco Institute being interviewed by Diane Magnum. I believe there may be one there which is a John. Stossel interview as well and I just want to ask you generally, if you've seen those before and if you're familiar with them?",qo
answer,"You know, it really depends on which one. I have seen video clips played for me in trial and in deposition. Maybe it would be easier if I told you which ones that come to mind that I actually remember.",sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,Would that be easier perhaps?,bin
question,"That might, help. I'm willing to accept your suggestion.",sno
answer,"Okay. I have certainly seen played at least a very short snippet of the * 94 Congressional hearings. I see that in many trials. 1 Certainly have seen at least at some point in time the whole Ed Horrigan, Ted Koppel, Nightline interview played for me at some point in time, I have seen Anne Brpwder clips/ I couldn't tell yoU. It was.like a morning program show kind of stuff, talking about smoking and health issues. I've seen older video clips from the, from the '70s or late '60s as. well, I mean,. I've seen a lot of stuff- obviously oyer the years. Those are things that I remember just sitting here off the top of my head. Looking at screen shots isn't terribly helpful. I mean, I can tell certain individuals. Like, I can see Waxman here. So I assume we're talking about Waxman here and I can see Ted Koppel... So I'm assuming, you know, we're talking about the, the, the Ted Koppell Nightline interview. I see Johnston's face on one of these screen shots. So I'm pretty sure that's the '94. Congressional hearing. So. those are the kinds of things that I rememberJ",sno
question,"Okay. So let me ask a, let me break this .into two different groups'. The TV talk shows, the 20/20 and the Dateline shows, from what you've seen of those, were the spokespersons'for the tobacco companies and for The Tobacco Institute honest in telling the public what they knew and what they believed?",wh-d
answer,"I mean, I think in general they, they, they did believe those,statements. . I think their opinions were, were, strongly shaped by certain areas of evidence that in the scientific record that were lacking, that they had hung onto. And felt were absolutely critical to make much stronger statements with regard to some of these issues,. So yeah, I do believe -- I, I, I have no reason to think that they didn't believe the statements that they were making whether it's a CEO of the company or a spokesperson from TI in terms of what they believed the science said.",sno
question,"Would'you accept the fact that similarly bo- some questions I asked you not ipng ago that those persons, those spokespersons would know more than an average member of the American public about the accuracy of what, they were saying with specific' '..- reference to Barbara Morales, for example?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, in general, yes. I would agree to that, that again, with the same reservation as I had before, not knowing Barbara Morales or really what one individual may or may not be capable of knowing. . But certainly, the probability is very high that people at the Tobacco Institute, people at the companies would have known more about their products than the average person.",y-d
question,"Now moving to a second category"" which.is the Congressional testimony under oath of the CEOs. I. believe you said that you recognized the president of Reynolds standing with other company presidents and CEOs arid you may have recognized Congressman Waxman and other Congressional officials. I want to ask you those same questions. So far as you know from watching those clips,- was that testimony under oath made to the Waxman Committee in 1994 completely truthful?",bin-d
answer,"I mean, I would have to say so. These folks were under oath and swearing before Congress. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that those statements they believed, that they actually believed those statements. And my recollection of the one clip that certainly you all show oftentimes at trial, Johnston is cut off when he's offering up a full some answer to the question by,.-, that Congressman. So he's not allowed to answer and in fact, the Congressman says I'll take that as a no. And what Johnston was trying to describe is what basically, what the.'64 Surgeon General's definition of addiction was and he was cut off. So I don't, you know, I. find that not to be -- I think that's slightly .rude but, of, course, at Congressional hearings that, happens from time to time.",y-d
question,"Your opinionabout whether it was rude of not rude notwithstanding, you dp agree that what was said was truthful?",bin-d
answer,"I believe that they/ that they believed what they were saying, yes.",y-d
question,"Just give me, just let me. finish this concept and I got one more question here and then one follow-up and we'll be done. '",sno
answer,I ill do one more. That's it.,sno
question,"Well, I want to know if you would agree that compared to the public and Barbara Morales that these men in the video would have, known more about the health effects and the addictive properties of cigarette smoking?",bin-d
answer,"I would say the same, answer I gave before. in all probability, they would, that they're in that business. I would presume that they 'certainly could,.",sno
question,"All right. One more, one more question.",sno
question,"I want to ask you one more question.. Please don't take off your microphone. I won't have any. . follow-up, but I want to know if you have done any research of study to compare Cuban cigarettes to Reynolds or Philip Morris cigarettes and if you plan to testify about that at trial?",bin-d
answer,"I have not done any research on Cuban cigarettes that I'm aware of. I don't really recall seeing any and I wouldn't, I wouldn't plan to do that.",dno
question,"Good afternoon. I'm going to be asking you a series of questions and if you understand them, please answer them. If you don't, I'll rephrase that question for you. If you need to take a break at any time, please just let us know, but I'll ask you to finish answering the question that has been asked at that time before we break.",co

answer,1975,sno
question,"Okay, Let's talk about your education background. Let's start let's start from high school if you'd like, when you graduated and what education you received after that, years and degrees.",wh-d
answer,"Okay. Graduated from high school in 1965, Connestoga High School, it's in Berwyn, Pennsylvania. It's a little town about 30 miles west of Philadelphia. From high school, I went to Ledman Valley College, this is in Anville, Pennsylvania. It's 16 around Harrisburg, that area. Graduated in with an ACS accredited BS in chemistry.",sno
question,Was that the extent of your college education?,bin
answer,"Well, I went to graduate school as well.",sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,"In 1969,I went to -- entered graduate school in Lehigh University for about a year, and then in 1970 to 1972, I was a member of the U.S. Army. I was stationed at the United States CM ON Environmental Hygiene Agency, Air Pollution Engineering Division and honorably discharged at rank of Special 5, which is a pay rank of a sergeant. I, in '72, I went back to Lehigh University, finished the requirements for a Master's, including a thesis and received a Master's in 1972. In 1973, I completed another thesis and the requirements for a Ph.d. At that point, I took a post doctoral research fellowship at Kansas University in Lawrence, Kansas at the School of Pharmacy, Department of Medicinal Chemistry and stayed there for two years until 1975 in which case I joined Lorillard.",sno
question,What was your Ph.D. thesis?,wh
answer,"The Synthesis and Medicinal Properties of 1,2,4 triazole, 1,3,5 diazapines.",sno
question,Now I understand why you left.,sno
answer,"They were candidate medicinal tranquilizers based on Valium structures, things like that. They didn't work either, but the synthesis was interesting.",sno
question,"And your post doc. work in Lawrence, Kansas, could you explain that in layman terms to me, please .",wh
answer,"I was working on candidate dopaminergics. If you modify the dopamine molecule, you can cause brain lesions, and we were trying to study Parkinson's Disease through chemically modified dopamines. I synthesized 3 0 or 40 analogs within the dopamine series.",sno
question,"When you started working for Lorillard in 1975, what was your position and what were your duties?",wh-d
answer,"I was a research chemist, and among other things, probably the major project that I ended up on as a research chemist was synthesis and purification of phenyl methyl oxidiazole. PMO, that's what they called it.",sno
question,And what are the properties of PMO if that's the correct way to phrase that?,wh
answer,What kind of properties? The physical properties?,confront
question,Yes. Why was Lorillard looking at the synthesis of PMO?,wh
answer,"Okay. Earlier in other words, before I joined Lorillard, a gentleman by the name of Dolham had determined that this material was an anti ciliastatic agent. Let me explain that. The cilia of the lungs wiggle and they move, move mucous up and down the trachea. One of the properties of tobacco smoke is to paralyze these cilia. This material -- at least momentarily paralyze them. This material was supposed to allow them to start wiggling again when breathed in.",sno
answer,"Well, again, this was a patent by Dr. Dolham and he had shown that it worked in very high concentrations. Unfortunately, it had a taste of gasoline or kerosene and it really wasn't applicable to cigarettes.",sno
question,How long were you in the position of research chemist for Lorillard?,wh
answer,"Until 1978, I was promoted to senior research chemist.",sno
question,"And as a senior research chemist, what were your duties?",wh-d
answer,"One of the major projects that I worked on as a senior research chemist was the Nicotine Augmentation Program, also known as NAP and successor versions of that, but in essence, it was the same study.",sno
question,What are the names of the successor versions of NAP?,wh
answer,"It's NAP, CONAP, Continuing Of, instance Of, It's --",sno
question,Is Lorillard still doing research with augmentation nicotine today?,bin
answer,Not that I know of.,n
question,When did they stop doing that?,wh
answer,"I don't know for a fact but it -- if I had to guess, I'd say in the early nineties maybe.",dno
question,And then could you define for me what augmentation of nicotine is?,wh
answer,"The -- it is an attempt to increase the nicotine to tar ratio based on the theory from the public health officials at the time, that nicotine was the reason people smoked, therefore, if tar was not good for you, therefore, if you increase the nicotine, reduce the tar, it would be a better cigarette for you.",sno
question,How long were you in the position of senior research chemist?,wh
answer,Till 1987.,sno
question,"And in 1987, what position or what were your duties?",wh
answer,I became the manager of the organic chemistry section and my duties were primarily to manage the group of chemists within that section.,sno
question,"And what does that mean, manage the chemists in that section?",wh
answer,"Give performance reviews, approve projects if they -- when they came up with projects, make sure that the resources were available within the section, make sure all of the equipment was continuously operating so we didn't have to wait around for two weeks until something was broken, essentially defend the section budget to senior management.",sno
question,And how long were you in that position?,wh
answer,Till 1993.,sno
question,"And then in 1993, what position did you fill and what were the duties associated?",wh
answer,"In 1993, I became Director of Research. At that time, it was managing research projects from five different sections.",sno
question,And what were those sections?,wh
answer,"Life sciences, organic chemistry, analytical chemistry, instrument development. I get them all? Technology application, I'm sorry.",sno
question,What is instrument development?,wh
answer,It was essentially a group of physical en chemists that either designed or modified instrumentation applicable to the industry.,sno
question,"And when you say instrumentation applicable to the industry, what is that?",wh-d
answer,"An example would be a development of a cigarette calorimeter, for example, a way to measure heat output from a cigarette. They designed, built and operated that type of instrument. They would work on a lot of thermal properties of matter.",sno
question,And technology applications?,bin
answer,"Technology application was in trying to take commercial technologies that existed anywhere in the world and apply it to within the industry itself. For example, one of the things was a Tegra, which is an instrument that looks at raw tobacco leaf and removes strings and chicken feathers and things like that that we really want to get out of there. And we successfully transferred that to the main plant.",sno
question,And how long were you Director of Research for Lorillard?,wh
answer,I still hold that position.,sno
question,Okay. So from 1993 to the present?,bin
answer,That's correct.,y
question,Okay. And what does the Department of Life Sciences focus on for Lorillard?,wh
answer,Short term biological testing currently is what their charge is.,sno
question,And what are short term biological tests?,wh
answer,"Bacterial immunogen, that's -- immunogenesis, neutral red cytotoxicty in cells, micro nucleus, those would be some short term tests.",sno
question,What is a short term test as compared to a long term test? Can you give me a definition of short term versus long term?,wh
answer,"Essentially the distinction really is between animal studies and non animal studies, either cellular or bacterial.",sno
question,And which is the short term test?,wh
answer,The cellular.,sno
question,So animal studies are,sno
answer,"They would be much longer term, yes.",y-d
question,"Earlier, you mentioned something called the nicotine to tar ratio. Would you give me a definition of what that is?",wh-d
answer,"The amount of nicotine that is yielded from a cigarette on smoking, divided by the amount of tar, the concentration of the tar. It's usually weight, weight unit less value.",sno
question,How is that measured?,wh
answer,The FTC smoking parameters from the smoking laboratory are used to do that calculation.,sno
question,And do different cigarettes offer different nicotine to tar ratios?,bin
answer,"There is some small variance between them. It's very difficult to make to alter that ratio, not -- and still have a commercial product.",sno
question,And what do you mean by a commercial product?,wh
answer,Something that you can sell.,sno
question,And what currently sells a cigarette product on the market today?,wh
answer,"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're asking.",nu
question,"Well, you use a commercially product with the nicotine to tar ratio. What would be the lowest ratio you would see as a viable commercial product?",bin-d
answer,"I think a zero tar cigarette would be possible and still be a cigarette and if it were, I don't think anybody would buy it.",sno
question,Do you think that nicotine is an essential component to a cigarette?,bin
answer,"My personal opinion, yes, I do think it's an essential component.",y-d
question,"And is that what you were referring to when you said nicotine to tar ratio product? A, What I was referring to was a measured quantity from the smoking laboratory. I mean nicotine is nicotine. Is that what you're asking?",bin-d
question,I'm looking for a number on the nicotine to tar ratio.,sno
question,Okay. Let's start with do you know what the current nicotine measurements are for Lorillard brands on the market today?,wh
answer,". I don't know the numbers to the second decimal place no, first decimal place, no.",n-d
question,That's fine.,y
answer,I have a rough idea of what they are.,sno
question,What is your rough idea?,wh
answer,Somewhere around 1 1/2 would be milligrams per cigarette.,sno
question,"My question to you is do you know the nicotine measurements on Lorillard products on the market, FTC measurements on the market today?",bin
answer,"Yeah, that's how I answered.",y
question,"To clear it, could you please answer that again?",wh
answer,"Okay. Somewhere between 1, 1 1/2 maybe, that's just my guess. I don't know the numbers. I haven't memorized -- the milligrams per cigarette. I haven't memorized any of the tar and nicotine numbers.",dno
question,"Okay. And for tar, I'll ask you the same question, the FTC measurements of tar for the Lorillard products?",bin
answer,"Again, again, I'm going to be guessing, it would just be -- it's just my guess that they can be anywhere from five milligrams to 15 milligrams per cigarette.",sno
question,What would be considered a low tar yield cigarette?,wh
question,Your view.,sno
answer,"Six to 8 milligrams would be considered low tar, I'd consider that low tar.",sno
question,And what materials or facts are you basing that view on?,wh
answer,Possibly my understanding of the spectrum of tar range throughout the cigarette industry.,sno
question,Could you explain what that spectrum of tar range in the industry is?,wh
answer,"Well, I mean it would be dependent upon a lot of factors, but different cigarettes would give different tar ranges, for example, a non filtered cigarette would be extremely high, whereas an ultra filtered product would be 1, 2 milligrams, something like that, a very large range of tar deliveries.",sno
question,What would be the range for an extremely high tar yield non filtered cigarette?,wh
answer,"Non filtered cigarettes, again, I would 23 have to be guessing but I would certainly say milligrams would be a very high yield for non filtered cigarette. www.raidwestlitigation.com Phone: 1.800.280.DEPO(3376) Fax: 314.644.1334 http://www.raidwestlitigation.com",sno

question,Do you work with any behavioral scientists at Lorillard?,bin
answer,No.,n
question,Do you know if Lorillard employs any behavioral scientists?,bin
answer,Not to my knowledge.,n
question,"While working at Lorillard, do you believe that smoking and tobacco use causes disease?",bin
answer,Are you asking for my personal opinion or company policy?,or
question,Let's start with your personal opinion.,wh
answer,"Okay. I think it may cause disease. I don't think it has been scientifically proven. I am a hard scientist, so I like to see data. I like to see a specific animal model. I like to see a dose response curve. I like to see mechanistic understanding of causation, so I will qualify that and say it may cause disease.",sno
question,Okay. And what is Lorillard's position on smoking and tobacco use causing disease?,wh
answer,Lorillard has agreed not to debate with the Surgeon General and his contention that smoking can cause disease.,sno
question,And do you agree with the Surgeon General's smoking reports and there are a number of them out there that state that smoking causes disease?,bin-d
question,Personal view.,sno
answer,"I'm sorry, ask the question again, please.",nu
question,"Do you personally believe that the Surgeon General's reports on smoking, represent links between tobacco use and disease are accurate?",bin
answer,Are you using the word links to mean causation?,bin
question,Yes.,y
answer,"Again, my personal belief is that there may be -- there may be that link there.",sno
question,"What is your definition of causation, your scientific definition of causation?",wh
answer,"Okay. Causation, my own personal understanding of causation would be the requirement of a specific mechanistic understanding of the cause and effect.",sno
question,Do you know if Lorillard has a view on causation?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,And what is that?,wh
answer,"Again, this is a company policy, and as I said, they have agreed not to debate any causation issue with the Surgeon General's contention, smoking causes disease.",sno
question,What diseases have you personally heard being linked or caused from smoking and tobacco use?,wh
answer,"The three major areas that I've certainly seen on our website that we agree with the Surgeon General with is certainly lung cancer, heart disease, COPD.",sno
question,"Have you heard of any other diseases, being -- has Lorillard heard of any other diseases being linked to smoking and tobacco use?",bin

If there's a question you don't understand, please let me know. If you answer a question, I'm going to assume that means that you understood the question. Have you been deposed before?",bin-d
answer,Yes.,y
question,How many times?,wh
answer,Once.,sno
question,Okay. And what case was that for?,wh
answer,This was in an employment related case.,sno
question,Okay. What is your current home address?,wh
answer,"Greensboro, Zip Code, 27455.",sno
question,Okay. And what's your office address?,wh
answer,"420 English Street, Greensboro, Zip Code 27405.",sno
question,Okay. Let's go through your educational history and if you could just tell me where you went to school and what degrees you earned and what year that was all accomplished.,wh
answer,You want me to start with high school?,bin
question,Sure.,y
answer,"Okay. Graduated high school in 1966. I then attended the University of Pennsylvania and had a BS in chemistry in 1970. Then I went to the University of Arizona from 1972 to 1979, got both master's and Ph.d's in organic chemistry at the University of Arizona.",sno
question,And when were you first employed with Lorillard?,wh
answer,August of 1979.,sno
question,Have you had constant employment with Lorillard since then?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,Have you worked for any other tobacco companies?,bin
answer,NO.,n
question,Have you worked for any other companies?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,What were those companies and what was that type of employment?,wh
answer,"Between undergraduate school and graduate school, I was employed by Nabisco in Fair Lawn, New Jersey as a product development chemist.",sno
question,Have you worked for any other companies?,bin
answer,No.,n
question,Have you ever been asked to consult on anything outside of Lorillard since your employment here?,bin
answer,No.,n
question,Have you ever been retained as an expert for any reason?,bin
answer,No.,n
question,"Well, let's go through your work history at Lorillard. And know from the first year what your different job titles have been and we'll just start from your first year of employment up to the present.",wh-d
answer,"Okay. I began in '79 as a research chemist. And approximately six or seven years later, I believe it was, I was promoted to senior research chemist. And then some years later than that, I apologize, I don't remember the exact year, I was promoted to manager. At that time I was managing a section within the Research Department called the Organic Chemistry Section. And then a few years later, the Director of Research and I decided it was appropriate to change the name of the section, although the position didn't change, just changed the name of the work from organic chemistry to tobacco chemistry. And then in December of 2002, I took my current position, which is Manager, External Research.",sno
question,"I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.",dno
answer,"Manager, External Research.",sno
question,What were what does a research chemist do for Lorillard back in '79? What were your duties in that job?,wh
answer,I was hired as an organic synthesist and my duties were to work in the laboratory and to synthesize various molecules.,sno
question,"And what were you looking for when you were synthesizing various molecules? You'll have to excuse me, I'm not an organic chemist. CM",wh
answer,"That's fine. The project was aimed at trying to understand relationships between chemical structure and odor and taste. And the idea was to understand enough about structure, odor and taste relationships to be able to design flavorants that would make cigarette taste appealing, maybe take a cigarette that is very low in tar and make it taste like a Marlboro, so that there would be good consumer acceptance, despite having very low tar.",sno
question,"Now, you mentioned Marlboro, is that the industry standard for cigarette taste?",bin
answer,"I don't really know if it's the industry standard. I think probably Marlboro was selected because it was the largest selling product, it had the greatest consumer acceptance.",dno
question,"Now, when you were promoted to senior research chemist, that was a promotion?",bin-d
answer,Yes.,y
question,What was your -- what were your job duties then?,wh
answer,"Pretty much the same, I was just able to work at a more independent level.",sno
question,"And then you said a couple of years later, so sometime in the mid eighties?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
answer,"Let me think, I think it was -- I think it might have been around '91 or '92 that I was promoted.",sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,"I apologize again, I don't recall the exact year it was. Yes, I was promoted to manage the group that I had been working at up until that point.",dno
question,What were your duties then as a manager?,wh
answer,"I would be responsible for conducting performance reviews of the staff, for overseeing annual project activities, annual budgets, helping make decisions along with the research director and the senior officers in the R and D area about what project activities and how technical resources within the work group that I was responsible for would be applied.",sno
question,So you added administrative duties then?,bin
answer,"Yes, I didn't work in the laboratory any longer. I gave up working at the bench at that point.",y-d
question,"In about f91, you stopped working in the l a b ?",bin-d
answer,"Yeah, '91, '92, somewhere in that neighborhood, I believe.",so
question,Do you miss working in the lab?,bin
answer,Very much so.,y
question,"Do you ever go back and just for fun, play in the lab equipment?",bin
answer,The staff gets a little nervous when they see me put on a lab coat.,sno
question,"So today, even though the job title has changed, you're doing the same job that you were promoted to in '91?",bin-d
answer,Not since my last job title change in December of '02.,sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,I have a different role now from what I had up until that point.,sno
question,What is your role today?,wh
answer,"I manage external research, which is a role where I do not have any direct reports at all. The way that I would explain the role is my job is to develop and machine external partnerships and collaborations with academic and non academic institutions that are aimed at complimenting our internal scientific expertise and advancing fundamental scientific understanding of smoking",sno
question,So yon have nobody in Lorillard that reports to you directly?,bin
answer,That's correct.,y
question,And who do you report to?,wh
answer,I report to Dr. Carr Smith.,sno
question,And do you know who he reports to?,wh
answer,Yes.,y
question,And who would that be?,wh
answer,He reports to Dr. William True.,sno
question,And do you know who Dr. True reports to?,wh
answer,Yes.,y
question,And who would that be?,wh
answer,Mr. Martin Orlowsky.,sno
question,And do you know who Mr. Orlowsky reports to?,wh
answer,"I don't know that he reports to anyone within Lorillard. He is the CEO, the president and the chairman.",sno
question,"All right. Okay. Who do you collaborate with outside of Lorillard on these different academic we'll start with the academic ones, academic projects?",wh
answer,"I can answer the question maybe somewhat differently but still get to what I think you're wanting to know, if you want to know with whom we have external relationships.",sno
question,Yes.,y
answer,"Because these relationships are all very different, some of them are very independent where we just fund the research and we do not directly collaborate. The research is conducted independently. And in some cases, the research is very direct and very focused and there is a very close collaboration. At the present time, we have collaboration going with Dr. Corwin Hatch of Pomona College and Dr. Roger Garg, who I believe is with CIarkson University, I believe that's in Pottstown, New York and Dr. Carr Smith of our organization, and there may be one or two other people within our organization that are contributing to that project. That project is involved with quantitative structure activity relationships.",sno
question,Okay. Could you give me a layman's terms of quantitative structure relationships for this project?,bin
answer,I'm not very expert in this. I'll do my best .,sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,"This is really outside of my scientific discipline, so this is not necessarily going to be as accurate as it might be if you talked to Carr about it, for instance. My understanding is QSAR, or QSAR as people call it, involves mathematical calculation of properties of classes of compounds that predict those properties based on measured values for representatives compounds within that class.",sno
question,"And when you say compound, what are you referring to?",wh-d
answer,"They're different classes of chemicals, alcohols, for instance, would be a class of chemicals. So if you were to apply QSR to alcohols, the technique enables you to predict things like siability, volatility, perhaps some biological properties by having measurements on a small number of alcohols and deriving relationships, mathematical relationships, between those properties and those alcohols that you could then use to calculate what the properties would be for other alcohols that you did not actually make those measurements on.",sno
question,Okay.,ack
answer,"And I believe this is a technique that is widely used for, for instance, food additives, possibly pharmaceuticals, I think it's probably very widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. And as I say, this is outside of my technical expertise.",so
question,"Okay. But in your position here at Lorillard, you these different projects run through you, do you approve these?",bin-d
answer,"No, I don't approve them, my role is to build the relationships, identify either academic resources or non academic resources that will compliment our internal expertise or that will represent scientific areas and fundamental research areas that we believe are important to support and to establish those relationships, and then to broker whatever contracts, whatever documentation needs to be put in place between scientific staff, internal and scientific and administrative staff externally to consummate these deals, these relationships, so it's not really a technical role.",n-d
question,"Okay. So somebody in Research and Development are grouped in one of your own science labs would come to you and say we need X, Y and Z in this area, and you would go out and find third-parties to fulfill that area?",bin-d
answer,"Yes. Sometimes I would have to find someone, sometimes the scientific personnel would already know people that were active in a particular field or had a particular technological capability, and they would identify those people and ask me to contact them, handle all the administrative arrangements with the institution.",y-d
question,"And with your background in organic chemistries, are you using your own scientific knowledge in brokering these deals or are you now mainly an administrative person that has no say on any of the science going on?",or
answer,The latter.,sno
question,Okay.,ack
question,Do you have any stock options?,bin
question,Do you receive any bonuses?,bin
question,Do you have a retirement plan fund or contributed to by Lorillard?,bin
question,"Do you know if Lorillard, what their contributions to your 401K are?",wh
question,Do you know if they have ever reached the legal ceiling?,bin
answer,With me?,nu
question,Yes.,y
answer,I doubt it.,n
question,Okay. What are the pension benefits?,wh
question,We talked about funded research and you mentioned Penoma College?,bin
answer,Pomona.,sno
question,"I'm sorry, Pomona. I should be able to pronounce that, what funded research is Lorillard currently involved in?",wh
answer,There's one funded research that we have going on at the present time and it involves Davis Heart and Lung Institute at Ohio State University.,sno
question,And what is that project?,wh
answer,We brokered I brokered a deal that we consummated last December with the director of the Davis Heart and Lung Institute and the company made a gift to fund the establishment of a new biomedical research center on smoking induced disease.,sno
question,And does Lorillard have any input on the types of research that the Davis Center is doing?,bin
answer,No.,n
question,"Okay. Now, the directed research you talked about, what projects are going on within the directed research?",wh-d
answer,"The directed research is really pretty narrow in scope right now. There are, besides the QSR program that I mentioned, I think it's accurate to say there are two others at the present time, one of them is with an individual in Minnesota, who is an expert in flavoring in calculation and controlled release. And one is with a company called Dimon, D-i-m-o-n, which involves supporting an agronomy program that Dimon has to try to understand what OJ CM CD agricultural practices correlate with low TSNA formulation in burly tobacco types.",sno
question,Could you please give me the full name of TSNA?,wh
answer,TSNA is an abbreviation for tobacco specific nitrosamines.,sno
question,And so this group in Minnesota is looking at producing a particular type of burly tobacco?,bin-d
answer,"No, no, no, there are two separate programs, the one in Minnesota has nothing to do with burly tobacco.",n-d
question,Okay.,ack
answer,The one in Minnesota involves an individual who is an expert in encapsulation of flavors.,sno
question,"I'm sorry, that was my mistake. The Dimon group is working on the burly?",bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,And what are they are they trying to develop a new strain of burly tobacco?,wh
answer,"My understanding, and again this is outside of my scientific expertise, I'm not an agronomist and I'm really not very knowledgeable about tobacco growing, but my understanding is that they're examining the various parameters, fertilization, moisture, curing techniques trying to understand which of these variables are correlated or important to the production, the natural production of TSNA in burly tobacco.",sno
question,"Thank you for that clarification. The individual in Minnesota working on flavoring encapsulation, why would Lorillard be looking in that direction?",wh-d
answer,"The interest in encapsulation of flavor for my understanding is that as technologies are identified to remove in some fashion, components of cigarette smoke, there are deficiencies in those technologies in that those same technologies remove flavor, important constituents, specifically menthol. And as a cigarette company whose biggest selling product is a menthol product, we're interested in finding techniques that could overcome that deficiency so that we could potentially produce products that selectively remove undesirable components of the aerosol but do not negatively impact the delivery of menthol.",sno
question,"Now, you just mentioned undesirable components.",sno
answer,Uh-huh.,ack
question,Could you describe what those undesirable components are?,wh
answer,I think generically people focus on what's called the Hoffman list. There are various lists that I've seen that have been put forth by different people in public health community and elsewhere. I think the one that people seem to attach the most significance to is the so-called Hoffman list.,sno
question,And how many compounds are on the Hoffman list just roughly?,wh
answer,"It's 40 some odd, I think it's between and 50, I believe.",so
question,So would you consider yourself an expert in organic chemistry at this point?,bin
answer,I'm not sure I know what you mean by an expert. I will tell you that it's been quite a few years since I practiced as an organic chemist and whatever expertise I had at that time is probably obsolete by this point.,dno
question,You don't take continuing education in organic chemistries?,bin
answer,"No, I do not.",n
question,What do you know about this particular case. The City of St. Louis versus several different tobacco companies?,wh-d
answer,"I've read the -- I'm not certain that I have the legal terminology correct, but I've read the -- is it called the petition or the complaint?",y-followup
question,Yes.,y
answer,"I've read that, so I'm aware that the hospitals or most of the hospitals or a large group of hospitals in the City of St. Louis are suing the tobacco industry and various related businesses to the tobacco industry seeking to recover costs that the hospitals have incurred in providing care to indigent people who are smokers.",sno
question,"Before your deposition today, did you meet with any attorneys?",bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,Did you meet with any other Lorillard employees?,bin
answer,NO.,n
question,How long did you meet with the attorneys before this deposition?,wh
answer,"Oh gosh, we had a number of meetings, each of the meetings was anywhere from an hour to maybe two, two to three hours. I don't recall exactly how I many meetings, several.",sno
question,Okay. In a long span of time like in a month or in a week?,qo
answer,It's probably been four to six weeks.,sno
question,"Okay. Going back to your time in school, a very well known Pack 10 School, did you ever learn any information about tobacco at that time while you were in school?",bin-d
answer,No.,n
question,Did you learn while in Arizona about tobacco causing disease?,bin
answer,"I'm not sure I know what you mean by learn, you mean as part of my formal training or my classroom --",dno
question,"Part of your formal training, yes.",y-d
answer,No.,n
question,"Okay. Informally, during those college years, did you know anything about tobacco being linked to any sort of diseases?",bin
answer,"Well, I was surrounded by a lot of people that were smokers. I'm not a smoker myself, and certainly I had an opinion that smoking was not healthy behavior in which to engage. But if you're asking did I have any scientific awareness or scientific study of that, no.",sno
question,Who were the people who were smoking around you at that time?,wh
answer,"Well, faculty and other graduate students.",sno
question,Any members of your family?,bin
answer,"When I was a kid., both of my parents smoked, yes.",y-d
question,Are your parents living today?,bin
answer,My mother is.,sno
question,"Today, do you know which diseases have been linked to tobacco smoking?",wh
answer,"If you're asking do I know from a factual, scientific point of view, no, I don't, but I've certainly -- I'm certainly aware of what people say and what people have represented, especially in the health community. I've heard certainly lung cancer and some other diseases, I'm not sure I can give you a list, comprehensive list. I mean I just know generically, cigarette smoking is bad for you.",n-d
question,Okay. Have you heard of emphysema being linked to cigarettes?,bin
answer,Sure.,y
question,And various cancers to different body parts?,bin
answer,"Again, I've heard that, I'm not sure I really -- beyond lung cancer, I'm not sure I really could identify any other specific ones.",dno
question,"And since 2002, your job has been to broker scientific experiments and projects for Lorillard and you're not able to link smoking with suggestive diseases?",bin-d
answer,Could you go back and give me that a piece at a time? I really lost the thread of what you're asking.,confront
question,"Okay. Today, your job at Lorillard is to broker third parties with research that Lorillard wants to have done?",bin
answer,"Yes, that's correct.",y
question,"And in that position, you are not able to say scientifically that these diseases have been suggested or linked to tobacco smoking, one of which is different cancers to different body parts?",bin-d
answer,"Let me try to give you a little better clarification of what my role is. The scientific scope of the external relationships that I broker is an area in which I don't have any input. The scope, the relevance, the priority, the determination of what programs to try to consummate where, that's not done by me, and I don't have really any input in that part of it.",sno
question,"Thank you for that clarification. Now, you mentioned earlier when you were giving me a definition of your current management role, you said smoking and health?",bin-d
answer,Uh-huh.,ack
question,Could you define for me what you mean by smoking and health?,wh
answer,"I can tell you what it means to me. What it means to me is scientifically I'm aware that there are some gaps in fundamental understanding of the relationship between exposure to cigarette smoke I oi and various diseases. Now, I don't understand or presume to understand how those gaps are identified, I am aware that they are there, and my understanding of that part of my role is that we're interested in supporting fundamental research that is aimed at or is likely to make progress in filling in some of those fundamental gaps and scientific understanding. And the program that we are funding at Ohio State at Davis Heart and Lung Institute, I think, is a very strong example of that kind of work.",sno
question,Do you understand the term product stewardship?,bin
answer,"I certainly have my own concept of what product stewardship means, especially from the time I worked in the food industry. I'm aware that there is a product stewardship effort within Lorillard, but again, that's not something in which I'm directly involved or have ever been directly involved.",sno
question,"In the food industry, what was the product stewardship?",wh
answer,"Well, again, as a product development chemist, working in the food industry more than years ago, at that time, what that meant to me was that we were very particular about making sure that any ingredients that we were formulating with and our products all met the specifications, and that everything was very consistent and verifiable and reproducible. And that our products were the highest quality and the best that we could produce.",sno
question,Does safety come into that idea of product stewardship?,bin
answer,"Well, safety is a pretty broad term. I know -- I know at Nabisco, the only aspect that I could directly relate to safety was there was microbiological testing of everything to make sure there was no mold or bacteria, I suspect was one of those things, but remember, I'm a chemist and from my perspective, I think in compositional terms. So if you've got an ingredient, you have specifications of what the content or what the composition is supposed to be, and you want to -- and within my universe, that would mean that you would have specifications as to what the composition would be and you would be measuring all of your raw materials and your finished products against those compositional specifications.",sno
question,"Do you know if that happens at LoriHard, this measurement of compositions as you just described?",bin
answer,I believe it does.,so
question,"As a chemist, are you familiar with the Chemist's Code of Conduct?",bin
answer,The Chemist Code of Conduct is not something I'm familiar with not under that label.,sno
question,Okay. Or the Chemist's Creed by the American Chemistry Society Council in 1965?,or
question,Not familiar with that?,bin
answer,"No, I haven't run across that.",n
question,"Okay. While working at Lorillard, do you believe that smoking and tobacco use causes disease?",bin
answer,You're asking my personal opinion; is that correct?,bin-d
question,"Yes, while working here at Lorillard.",y-d
answer,Yes.,y
question,And how does that idea work with your understanding of product stewardship?,wh
answer,I'm not sure I understand what you're asking me.,dno
question,"Well, you explained what you understood product stewardship to be personally, particularly when you were working in the food industry,",bin-d
question,Has that -- start with a different question. Has that idea of product stewardship changed for you at all?,bin
answer,"Product stewardship is really something outside of my area of activity or my role. And it's not something that I really spend time thinking about. You asked me what the term product stewardship means to me personally, individually and I've told you that. I'm not sure -- I'm not sure how to answer your question. I'm not sure I understand how to answer your question.",sno
question,"You work in and have worked in a particular department for Lorillard, and would you agree that the work you do has an impact on the product that is actually put out on the market?",bin-d
answer,The work that I'm doing currently could potentially have an impact on future products and is not connected to current products or current product activity.,sno
question,"When you were working as a researcher in your first job at Lorillard, do you know if your work had any impact on any products or product lines?",wh-d
answer,"Regrettably, I don't think it did.",dno
question,Why do you say regrettably?,wh
answer,"Well, people like to feel like they're contributing in some tangible and impactful way. And none of the things that I worked on in that initial role ever had any commercial implementation, so there really wasn't any impact. The one thing that we did do I recall and I think this happened maybe in the late eighties, that gave me a little bit of satisfaction, at that time, The National Cancer Institute, I think, was screening large numbers of novel chemicals for potential as aids or treatments for cancer, and we submitted a large number of the experimental flavorants that we had developed to that program, along with all the data that we had accumulated on them, but none of those materials were ever used commercially by Lorillard, so we never had any impact on our products.",sno
question,Do you have any children?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,What are their ages?,wh
answer,I have a daughter who's 18 and a son who's 14.,sno
question,Have you ever talked to them about smoking?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,What have you told them?,wh
answer,That it's very dangerous and they should not do it.,sno
question,And are they aware that you work for a tobacco company?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,Have you talked to them about that?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,And what have you said to them about that?,wh
question,Has Lorillard ever produced a O-milligram tar cigarette?,bin
answer,That sounds more like a PD question and I honestly don't know.,dno
question,"When you say PD, what do you mean?",wh
answer,Product development.,sno
question,Thank you.,ack
answer,Sorry.,ack
question,Would a zero tar cigarette be healthier?,bin
answer,"I don't know how you would define healthier. I think a zero tar cigarette would potentially expose smokers to lower amounts of chemical constituents in the aerosol, but whether that would translate into something that causes less disease or not, I don't have any idea. That would take a lot of epidemiological study over a long period of time to be able to document that. I would hope that it would, but I don't know that it would.",dno
question,So you've explained to your son in particular that you feel like you're in a position that could positively impact this particular industry?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,"Hypothetically, what would you want to see this industry develop into?",wh
answer,"I can only answer the question you're asking in a very personal way. And so that's what I'm going to -- that's how I'm going to respond. I'm very proud of the fact that I had an opportunity to broker this deal with Ohio State last year. I think that is a very significant achievement because I really believe that the. quality of research that is being supported by my company there is exactly the kind of research that, over time, could be measurably impactful on the incidence of disease among smokers. I can't tell you specifically how that would be, it's just that there is this enormous multi disciplinary effort there and I think the funding that we are providing there is very significant, and I know that the researchers there think that the funding that we're providing there is very significant.",sno
question,So are they actually working on producing new products?,bin
answer,"No, no. OSU is not working on producing new products. OSU is working on understanding in greater detail the mechanism of smoking induced disease.",n-d
question,And so you would want to take that information and apply it to creating a product that doesn't cause disease?,bin
answer,I think the ability to do that would be many years in the future. This is very fundamental research. It does not have any kind of commercial or practical application in the short term at all.,sno
question,So are you saying that your products today do cause disease?,bin
answer,"In my opinion, I think they can cause disease, yes, especially lung cancer.",y-d
question,Do you know why people smoke?,wh
answer,"No, I don't.",n
question,Do you think people smoke because of nicotine?,bin
answer,"I think that people smoke -- I think the reasons that people smoke are very complicated. I don't think there is just a single reason. This is all my personal opinion. It's a little difficult for me to really comment on this since I've never smoked, I've never been a smoker. I don't really understand from personal experience what the appeal is, but my observation of people who do smoke informs me or leads me to believe that it's a very complex behavior with a lot of different reasons across different individuals.",sno
question,"How about from a scientific perspective, do you have an understanding of how nicotine physiologically impacts the body?",bin
answer,"No, again, I remind you, I'm a chemist not a toxicologist or a physiologist biomedical professional, that's really outside my area of knowledge scientifically.",n-d
question,Do you know if Lorillard's ever added nicotine to their tobacco products?,bin
answer,"I'm not aware that Lorillard has ever added nicotine. I mean, there is an indigenous amount of nicotine in the tobacco leaf and I don't believe that we've ever -- I'm not aware that we've ever produced a product that has more nicotine than was in the leaf to begin with.",sno
question,Do you know if Lorillard as a company has a position on nicotine and nicotine addiction?,bin
answer,You're talking about like an official position?,bin
question,Yes.,y
answer,"The only official positions that I have any awareness of are what I've read on the company's website. I don't recall seeing anything there specifically about nicotine or nicotine addiction. I'm thinking the only thing I remember specifically is a statement that the company's public statement that, excuse me, that the company believes that cigarette smoking can cause serious disease, including lung cancer, and that smoking can be addictive for some people. Beyond that, I don't recall reading anything, and I'm not in a role where I would have any input into those kinds of positions or have any awareness of what they would be or what they are, I just don't know.",dno
question,So you mentioned Lorillard's website. Do you know how many websites Lorillard has?,wh
answer,I've only seen one.,sno
question,Okay. Did you have any input to the health and safety section of that website?,bin
answer,"No, I did not.",n
question,Okay. Earlier you mentioned the National Cancer Institute. Have you read any of the monographs put out on smoking by the National Cancer Institute?,bin-d
answer,"No, I have not.",n
question,Have you heard about them?,bin
answer,I've heard people talking about them. I know they exist.,sno
question,Okay. Have you read any of the Surgeon General reports on smoking that have been produced over the years?,bin
answer,I think I may have read or glanced through one or two of them over the years but I've not studied them. I've not read them in any kind of depth.,dno
question,Do you yourself currently read scientific journals and literature?,bin
answer,"For probably the last four or five years, most of what 1 read is technical literature that has more to do with how external relationships are managed, what best practices are the companies engaged in, how companies value and assess the various external relationships that they consummate. I've read a lot about the various techniques and postures that academic institutions take in dealing with various industrial organizations regarding publications and intellectual property issues and so forth. That's most of what I find myself reading now.",sno
question,"Excuse me. Do you have any control over the publications, the scientific publications released by Lorillard?",bin
answer,"No, I do not.",n
question,How about with the parties that you broker with that are doing research projects either funded by Lorillard or in conjunction with Lorillard?,qo
answer,"As an individual, I do not, but there are frequently provisions written into the various agreements that address publication for directed studies.",sno
question,What are those provisions that you're speaking of?,wh
answer,"Well, in the case of a directed study, if there's a potential for intellectual property as an outcome of the research, then the timing of any publication is important in terms of not interfering with the ability to pursue a patent or some sort of intellectual property. So that's -- that's basically the extent of it.",sno
question,Do you know if Lorillard has kept or limits the publication of any scientific results of materials from any of these relationships the company has with research?,bin
answer,"In the case of directed research, as I say, the only interest that Lorillard would have that would be relevant to publication is that publication be timed in a fashion that does not interfere with being able to pursue patent where that's appropriate. In the case of non directed or just sponsored research, such as we have at Ohio State, no, there's absolutely no relationship, there's absolutely no provision whatsoever regarding publication. I would say maybe this is a stretch, because I don't think this is really what you're after but the expectation is is that if Lorillard has sponsored the research, that Lorillard will be acknowledged as the sponsor of the research anywhere that it is published. But as far as having any pre-review or control over what gets published or where it gets published or when it gets published, none whatsoever.",sno

question,What is your definition of addition?,wh
answer,"My personal definition of addiction? I have what is probably a minority personal definition of addiction compared to what I hear a lot of people say. Most people that I talk to would -- would lean OJ GO towards if something's too difficult to stop doing, then they would be inclined to label that addiction. I don't consider that personally addictive. To me, for something to rise to the level of my personal definition of addiction, it would have to be such a compelling behavior that you -- you just -- you would even steal and rob to have money in order to continue to feed your addiction. And, you know, something like heroin or crack cocaine is what rises to the level of addiction in my personal definition. But I know that's not a definition that's particularly widely accepted these days.",sno
question,How did you come to that personal definition?,wh
answer,"Just as a chemist, I've seen -- I've seen a lot of -- a lot of drug use over my lifetime. I mean, I'm a child of the Sixties, I saw a lot of that. I didn't participate in it, but I was -- I was an observer and I saw people that were very intelligent, I thought, just completely lose control of themselves. Q, So in understanding your definition of addiction, if it doesn't rise to the level of needing a gun or robbery in order to continue the particular use of the drug, it wouldn't be addiction?",sno
question,"So would you say a person who has no money and is going through a trash can looking for cigarette butts to smoke or to empty the tobacco out, would that fall into your definition of addiction?",wh-d
answer,"No, that would not meet my personal definition of addiction.",n-d
question,"If a person walked into a convenience store with a gun to get a package of cigarettes, would that meet your",bin-d
answer,That's that's getting closer to it. And it would have to be it would have to be repetitive to do that. It wouldn't -- it wouldn't be just a one time event.,sno
question,"So a person using heroin that never uses a gun, never resorts to any sort of violence to get their heroin, would not be addictive?",bin-d
answer,"I don't think -- I use that as an example. Someone who just has to rob or steal, I mean you don't need to use a gun to do that, you can do it, I suppose, stealthily and not have a weapon, it doesn't have to be armed robbery. I'm not trying to split hairs here, I'm just it's a very it's a very personal definition for me.",sno
question,Okay. I'm just trying to understand your definition. Do you believe that Lorillard has worked hard to develop --to develop a reduced risk cigarette product?,bin-d
answer,"I think Lorillard has worked hard to develop a reduced yield product and again, I'm not trying to split hairs, but my -- my concept is that it is possible to demonstrate scientifically that you have lowered the yield of certain chemical constituents in smoke. But I think it's a separate step having demonstrated a lowering of the yield of those components. I think it's a separate step to then demonstrate that a consumer of that product has a lower exposure. I think that requires some measurement of biological fluids and biomarkers to see if there was, in fact, a lower exposure because of the lower yield. And then I think it's an additional step beyond that if in fact you're able to demonstrate lower exposure. I think it's an additional step beyond that to demonstrate that the lower exposure, in fact, results in lower risk or lower harm, and I think that requires very extensive and very lengthy in time epidemiological studies to see whether the reduced exposure has in fact resulted in reduced incidence of disease.",sno
question,How would one measure biomarkers?,wh
answer,"You're asking a toxicological and a biomedical question. I don't know, what I've heard people talk about, what I've seen in some articles, I think there's some things that they look for maybe | in the blood or in the urine, maybe some other biological fluids. I really don't know scientifically how that's done.",sno
question,"Okay. It was just, you know, you mentioned it in your last response. So when you talk about lower yield product, could you define for me what you mean by yield?",wh-d
answer,"Surely. There are standard conditions that the FTC, for instance, has developed. There are other standard conditions that are used in Canada and in Europe that have been designed for machine smoking cigarettes, and the machine smoking is, as I understand it, a way to standardize the measurement system so that you can compare various products. I don't believe -- it's not my understanding that any of these smoking regimens have been developed and represented as being representative of how a person, how an actual person smokes. These are simply scientific parameters that are established so that people can reducibly make measurements in a standard sort of a way. And so to me, that is the way that you can address the yield. You would take a cigarette or multiple cigarettes, you would machine smoke them under these specified conditions and do chemical analysis on the various components of the smoke and make quantitative comparisons from these various fractions of the smoke across the different cigarettes. And so reduced yield would be the amount of Compound A from Cigarette 1 is more or less than the amount of that same compound from Cigarette 2 and the measurement is made under exactly the same conditions.",sno

question,"When you go to a restaurant, do you ask for a non smoking section?",bin
answer,"Actually, I don't. It doesn't bother me and when they ask me smoking or non smoking, I say, ""It doesn't matter. Put me wherever you want, it really doesn't matter."" Now, if I have my kids with me, then I always request non smoking.",sno
question,Why do you make that distinction for your children?,wh
answer,Because I -- I think I don't want them coming home smelling like cigarette smoke. I mean I work in an area where people smoke and it's not uncommon for me to come home smelling of smoke but my kids don't need to come home smelling like smoke.,sno
question,And that's the only reason you would choose non smoking?,bin
answer,"Yeah, pretty much.",y
question,You have no concerns about the secondhand smoke?,bin
answer,"No. I would say another reason is that I think my kids probably prefer it and, you know, they don't want to smell it. They don't like the smell. They object to the smell. They don't want to be near it, so I try to accommodate their preference.",n-d

answer,"I think that -- I think people ought to have that as an option. I think business owners ought to have that as an option, and I think people ought to have an option as to what businesses they want to patronize and what they don't.",sno
question,"What about for the non smoker, if you walk into a public place and you have a person smoking, the non smoker would not have an option then of not smelling smoke in that particular room.",sno
answer,"I think the non smoker and smoker deserves an option and I think if you leave it up to the business owner or the leadership of whatever the establishment is to set their own policy and they advertise that policy, then people can make a decision of where they want to go and where they want to avoid.",sno
question,"How about with hospitals, do you think it's good that hospitals are non smoking?",bin
answer,What do you mean by good?,wh
question,Why don't you give me a definition of what you think is good and we'll go from there.,wh
question,What is your personal definition of good?,wh
answer,"I don't think I can answer that. I've again, I don't want to split hairs but if you're asking as an individual, my personal opinion, do I think that it is beneficial or appropriate for a hospital to ban smoking, I think it could be because hospitals are places where ill people come. And ill people are often, their systems and their defenses biologically are compromised or weakened or something like that. And some of those individuals may be more at risk for reaction to cigarette smoke, so I don't think it would be inappropriate for hospitals to ban smoking. I know for a long time, it was permitted in hospitals here in Greensboro. Then it was restricted to certain places within the hospitals. And now it's restricted to certain designated areas outside the hospitals. And I think for the benefit of people that are at risk to having an adverse response to being around smoke, that gives them the opportunity, makes it a little easier for them not to endure that exposure and at the same time, gives the staff who smokes and visitors who smoke, gives them an option and an opportunity to smoke some place where they're segregated. So I think personally that that's not inappropriate.",dno
question,"Dr. Gains, that was a very good response. Thank you for rephrasing the question eloquently.",sno
question,"So from your comments, you believe smoking is free choice?",bin
answer,"Once again, I've never been a smoker. I really don't understand why people smoke. But my observation leads me to believe that some people choose to smoke for whatever reason.",sno
question,"Would you agree that in order to make a free choice, an individual must be presented with all relevant information?",bin
answer,"I don't know how -- how you could I mean how do you define what's relevant and how do you decide what all of it is? How do you identify what all of it is? I think -- I think the hazards of smoking have been very well publicized for a long time. I can remember as far back as high school and probably into elementary school, but I can't honestly at this age remember that far back, but I'm sure in high school, students would would look -- students that I hung out with would look around at kids that were smoking and really make disparaging remarks, you know, how you couldn't be an athlete if you smoked, it's very unhealthy, it's -- I mean it's not a scientific opinion that I'm giving you here, it's just personal observations. So I think it's pretty widely known that smoking is not healthy and is risky behavior and I think it has been for a very long time.",sno
question,So then are you saying that people are adequately informed on the dangers of smoking?,bin
answer,"Again, my opinion is I think -- I think there's been a very wide spread awareness of the hazards and risks associated with smoking for a very long time. And I think that awareness has been achieved in a lot of ways, certainly the Surgeon General statements and the warnings that have been put on packs and all cigarette advertising for many years. I think it's hard to imagine a situation where people would be totally insulated from awareness that smoking is hazardous.",sno
question,Do you have any examples of what Lorillard has done to inform individuals on the dangers or impacts of smoking?,bin
question,Have you ever heard of a controversy between smoking and health?,bin
answer,What do you mean by controversy?,wh
question,Controversy between the tobacco companies and the healthcare givers in this country?,bin
answer,"Let me put it this way, this is what I would say. As a scientist, it is very common for scientists to have differences of opinions about things, and certainly I'm aware that there have been differences of opinions expressed by scientists working in the tobacco industry and scientists working in the public health community for a long time. Now, whether that level of difference of opinion or disagreement rises to the level of what would be characterized as a controversy, I think that depends on what people think controversy means. I would characterize it as difference of opinion, disagreement among scientists. I'm aware of that but I don't see that as unique or unusual in any type of scientific endeavor that I've encountered in my life.",sno

question,Do you know if Lorillard sells cigarettes in Missouri?,bin
answer,I have no reason to believe otherwise. I believe Lorillard sells everywhere in the United States.,sno
question,What does it mean that a cigarette contains tar?,wh
answer,"Forgive me here because I'm very -- I'm very literal. I would disagree that a cigarette contains tar. What I would say is that a cigarette, when consumed, produces tar, generates tar, and the tar is a portion of the aerosol that's generated by the combustion of the cigarette.",sno
question,Does the combustion of tar differ with different kinds of cigarettes?,bin
answer,"Again, I'm very, very literal. The tar is not what's combusted, the tobacco and the paper are what's combusted. And the products of that combustion include tar. And if your question is is the tar from different cigarettes different, again, that's that's maybe a more complicated question to ask. If you mean compositionally is it different, I think yes, it can be. In terms of the amount that would be the result of combustion, Cigarette A versus Cigarette B and in terms of the analysis of the chemical components and the relative amounts of the chemical components in the tar as combustion product from Cigarette A to Cigarette B, yes, I think they can be different.",sno
question,"So would you believe in the combustion of tobacco, the tar that is the result, is that a harmful thing?",bin
answer,"Again, I think you have to be more specific about what you mean by harmful. I think there are chemical constituents in the tar that again, as a chemist, not as a toxicologist or biologist, I can't really speak to the biological effect, but what I know as a chemist is that the components of the tar include what are known to be very chemically reactive compounds and molecules. Now, how that translates into how it interacts with a biological system, is not my area of expertise. I just don't know how to answer that.",sno
question,Do you have any concept or idea of when Lorillard first became aware that tar is harmful?,bin
answer,No.,n
question,Would you believe that the medical community knows that tar is harmful?,bin
answer,"Again, I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean by the medical community. I'm not sure I know exactly what you mean by harmful. I would -- I would say that it's my belief that generally, and the medical community includes part of the public at large and people who work for Lorillard and other tobacco companies are part of the public at large. I think there is a very wide recognition that smoking is harmful and exposure to the smoke is -- has got to be involved with the harm, so since tar is part of the smoke, then I would have to say yeah, the medical community and people who work for tobacco companies are aware that tar can be harmful.",dno
question,Have you ever worked with additives used in the manufacturing process for Lorillard cigarettes?,bin
answer,I've never been involved with the manufacturing area at Lorillard at all. I think I'd have to answer that question no.,n-d
question,Have you ever studied the additives used by Lorillard in a chemical way?,bin
answer,What I've personally done earlier in my career was some chemical studies on some of the flavor materials. I looked at chemical stability under different storage conditions of some of the flavor materials. So those would be in the category I suppose of additives generally.,sno
question,"Dr. Gains, do you know if Lorillard has studied or is beginning to study the production of unconventional nicotine delivery devices? MR, ROWLEY: Object to the form, vague.",bin
answer,I'm really not clear on what you mean by unconventional nicotine devices. Could you be more specific?,nu
question,"A different way to give the consumer nicotine instead of lighting a cigarette, if there's another way to deliver nicotine?",bin-d
answer,I'm not aware of any such activity.,sno
question,"Okay. In your own personal opinion, do you think science will arrive at a level of proof with respect to smoking and disease? We talked earlier about disagreements with all the scientists. Do you think there would be a level of proof?",bin-d
question,I'll ask the question again.,sno
question,"In your opinion, will science ever arrive at a level of proof with respect to smoking and disease?",bin
question,Proof that there's -- that there is a direct link between smoking and disease?,bin
answer,"In terms of causality, causation?",nu
question,Yes.,y
answer,"I'll just I'll answer this way. As a chemist, I really don't know what will be involved from the biological and toxicological and pharmacological part of the science, which is where I think the gaps are. From a chemical standpoint, I don't know that chemically you can really get to causation. So I really -- I really can't answer that. I don't know. I think chemically over time there will be a better understanding of the combustion process and what the relationship is between components of what burns and components of the aerosol that results from what burns. But someone is going to have to figure out which components in the aerosol are most important or connected to the occurrence of any specific disease and I just don't know how that would play out. I don't really have an idea of how that would work. But I think chemically we'll understand better than we do now over enough time what the chemistry is of what's going on, but if you can't identify what chemically relates to disease, then I don't know that you ever are going to get to causation. I just don't have I just don't have the scientific knowledge to know whether that's solvable or not.",sno
question,"You've used the word causation, could you give me a definition of causation in respect to your last answer?",wh-d
answer,"Okay, as a chemist for me and understand, I'm aware that different scientific disciplines define causation in different ways. For me, as a chemist, the way that I was trained, causation is an understanding of a mechanism in great detail. You start with molecule A and you want to get to molecule Z and you need to understand each intermediate, each step in the mechanism from A to Z in order to say okay, if I do this, this, this and this, it will cause this as the end result. So I have a very different definition, based on my scientific training in the area of my scientific training as to what causation means than what I observe causation is is defined in, for instance, the public health community. They have a different way of defining causation. So I don't know if I've answered your question, but that's what causation means to me, is understanding the link, step by step, detailed mechanism, each individual step from the beginning to the end result that you're talking about. And in terms of the. relationship between smoking as a causation for specific disease, I don't have the scientific knowledge to know whether there's any possibility or likelihood that that will be worked out to fit my definition of causation. But I understand that different scientific disciplines have different standards of proof and 0 causation. But that's not what my personal one is. That's not what my scientific training leads me to.",sno
question,Do you know if Lorillard has done that type of chemical analysis for their products on what the different chemicals that are components of a cigarette smoke strike that. Let me rephrase the question. Do you know if Lorillard does experiments like you just described on the components of cigarette smoke?,wh-d
question,Do you know if Lorillard is doing experiments or research on the components found in smoke?,bin
answer,What I'm aware of chemically is that there are experiments to understand the relationship between the composition of the tobacco and the cigarette chemically and the composition of the smoke that results when that cigarette is burned. There are chemical studies to understand if you burn flue-cured tobacco exclusively what is the chemical composition of the smoke that comes from that versus if you burn burly tobacco exclusively. Are there chemical differences in the composition of the smoke from one to the other.,sno
question,Why would Lori l lard want to know that information?,wh
answer,"From a chemical standpoint, I can answer that there's an interest in understanding the relationship between the precursor chemically and the product, which compounds or components of leaf lead to which compounds or components of the aerosol so that there's a better understanding of the combustion process, and that would potentially lead to ideas of how to modify the combustion process in a way that modifies the composition of the aerosol in a predictable way.",sno
question,And why is it important to modify the composition of the aerosol?,wh
answer,"Well, for instance, carbon monoxide is a component of the aerosol, and I think it would be desirable to, as much as possible, eliminate the amount of carbon monoxide that is produced on combustion.",sno
question,And what does carbon monoxide -- what is the result of carbon monoxide in that smoke?,wh
question,Why would Lorillard want to produce carbon monoxide?,wh
answer,"We talked earlier about the Hoffman list. I believe carbon monoxide is one of the components on the Hoffman list so we would certainly be interested in lowering the content of anything that's on the Hoffman list in the smoke aerosol. And completely outside of the cigarette domain, I mean I know as a kid I was told, don't ever start up your car with the garage door closed, because you'll suffocate with carbon monoxide, so I don't know specifically biologically, but I certainly have the understanding that carbon monoxide is not something that's desirable to breathe if you could avoid it.",sno
question,What other agents on the Hoffman list would you want to avoid personally?,wh
answer,"I can't tell you I really know all 40 odd things that are on the Hoffman list. Again, speaking as a chemist, from my experience in the laboratory, the kinds of things that I believe are on the Hoffman list that -- just in laboratory environment I'd try to avoid would be formaldehyde fumes, benzene fumes. I believe there are some heavy metals on the Hoffman list. These are things that in a laboratory environment I know are toxic chemically speaking, so I would certainly want to limit my exposure to those things.",sno
question,And those chemically toxic components that you just mentioned are all found in the tobacco smoke?,bin
answer,"That's my understanding, yes.",y
question,Okay.,ack
answer,"There are over 4,000 things found in the tobacco smoke, I believe those are among them.",sno
question,"In your opinion, what responsibility do you think LoriHard has to its consumers?",wh
answer,"I really don't know how to even begin to answer that question. I -- my observation has been as a 25 year employee of this company that the company's leadership has been very proactive in doing a lot of measurement of all of the raw materials, all of the ingredients. I know that the company has spent tens of millions of dollars doing toxicological testing on all of the ingredients without any legal requirement to do so. I know that as a company within the industry, Lorillard has been very conservative in what it will permit to be used in our products compared to some of our competitors. I understand there's an industry list of ingredients that are used and have been used in cigarette products and I know that Lorillard uses a very, very small number of those ingredients. So from my personal standpoint, I think Lorillard has been very, very responsible over the time that I've been employed.",sno

question,"The second page, then, if you would turn to that, continues on at the last paragraph talking about the work of Drs . Wynder and Homburger .",sno
answer,Yes .,y
question,Do you see that?,bin
answer,Ui-huh .,ack
question,"And it says, ""Dr . Wynder and, unknown to him, Dr. Hamburger have both found that eighty to ninety percent of the mouse tumorigenic properties of cigarette tar resides in a fraction of the tar known as fraction, quote, B, close quote, period."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,Why -- why does it say that it was unknown to Dr. Wynder that Dr. Hamburger had also found the same results with regard to 80 to 90 percent of the tumorigenic properties residing in fraction B?,wh-d
answer,I presume Dr. Wynder did not know of the contract with Dr. Hamburger to try to duplicate his work.,sno
question,Why would you not advise one researcher that another researcher was also working on the same problem?,wh
answer,I don't know .,dno
question,"Then goes on to say, ""This fraction makes up only 2 percent of the tar by weight but it is extremely potent on the backs of mice . Our chemists have split fraction, quote, B, close quote, into three subfractions . One is made up of an assortment of terpenes, several of which have been identified ; 3srenas.c I another consists of an assortment of esters and many of the acids and alcohols in these esters have been determined; while the third and last subfraction contains"" -- Is that percillic, paracyclic? Can you read that?",bin-d
answer,Polycyclic .,sno
question,"""polycyclic hydrocarbons, including benzopyrene."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"At that point in time, do you know whether any work had been done by anyone other than Lorillard to subfractionate fraction B to find benzpyrene?",bin
answer,Dr. Wynder had .,sno
answer,Well he -- he also had chemists in his laboratory who had done this fractionation ahead of this work .,sno
question,The splitting of fraction B?,nu
answer,"They were -- Yes . They were working on that and publishing it, yes .",y-d
question,"So this work by your chemist, then, is not new work, it's confirmatory work of something already published by Dr. Wynder?",bin-d
answer,"Most of it, except for the DDD. That was a new finding .",sno
question,"Okay. You're referring now to the next line that says, ""However, in the last fraction our chemists have also found a significant amount of DDD, a chlorinated hydrocarbon insecticide .""",bin-d
answer,That's right .,y
question,That -- That compound was a new discovery in the subfractionation of fraction B?,bin
answer,"That it was in fraction B, yes . I don't know whether it was a new discovery that it was in tobacco smoke, but it certainly was -- would have been new to be -- to be in fraction D .",y-d
answer,"B . I'm sorry, I said D .",sno
question,"It goes on to say, ""This could be a very important discovery since, even if the insecticide is not a carcinogen itself, it might act as a promoter for the small quantities of benzopyrene. Dr. Wynder is the process -- is not aware of the presence of the insecticide but he has agreed to test the three subfi-actions in a somewhat superficial way to see if any of them possesses promoting properties . This will take five to seven months . In the meantime I would like to have pure DDD tested as a promoter in approximately the quantities found in cigarette smoke. I would prefer to have Dr. Homburger do this since, if we disclose our ideas to Dr . Wynder, he will give them premature publicity ."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"At the time of this discovery of the DDD in -- in the subfraction B smoke condensate, did Lorillard publish those results in any way in a journal of any kind?",bin-d
answer,"No. Following this, Lorillard went back and tried to reconfirm some of this work as to whether or not DDD was important in terms of the biological response .",n-d
question,"And you were concerned that if Dr . Wynder became aware o f the presence of DDD, that he would make that public; correct?",bin-d
answer,This was pure speculation on the part of the author that DDD was important in terms of any activity on the mouse skin at this point in time .,sno
question,"Well if you had two outside consultants working on the smoke condensate fraction B, wouldn't it have made good scientific sense to have both of them, then, continue their work looking at the subfraction to determine whether this was an important discovery?",qo
answer,"As I say, it was followed up .",sno
question,But not with Dr. Wynder for fear that he would make it public; correct?,bin-d
answer,"Dr. Wynder did perform additional experiments on fractions -- subfractions that we supplied to him, as I recall.",sno
question,Well the memorandum says that Dr . Homburger was going to do that. Did he perform those -- that work?,bin-d
answer,"He had performed different -- well the -- The experiments took a different form in that DDD was added to tobacco smoke . It was also added to tobacco and cigarette smoke to enrich them, enrich the smoke with DDD in two different ways, as I recall .",sno
question,Was there ever a time that Lorillard made public the discovery of DDD in cigarette smoke?,bin
answer,"No, I don't believe so, in that at this time framc the DDD was -- and DDT were banned for use as insecticides in tobacco, and what we were able to determine is that it really had minor effects on skin-painting .",n-d
question,. And how -- how was that determined?,wh
answer,"As I j ust described, by adding it to cigarette smoke condensate, as I recall, the DDT direct -- DDD directly, and also by applying it to tobacco, I think, and manufacturing cigarettes enriched with DDD .",sno
question,. And did you find that it acted as a promoter?,bin
answer,"I don't believe that -- I do i t believe you would call it a promoter in this kind of a test. What we did determine, it made a -- a -- potentially a small contribution to the activity on mouse skin .",sno
question,And do you believe that the failure of Lorillard to makc public discoveries of those constituents in cigarette smoke that were linked to cancerous activity in laboratory animals was a breach of their connnitment to the public in the Frank Statement to malce scientific information available to smokers about the cigarettes they were smoking?,bin-d
answer,"As I said, it was certainly known that there was DDD in cigarette smoke, this was published information, and certainly activity of the B fraction was published by Dr . Wynder. I'm not sure I understand what you would have us publish --",sno
answer,"-- other than Lorillard specifically isolated this. It was in the scientific literature . I don't think any investigators over the longer term considered this a significant finding, and secondarily, it was eliminated from tobacco .",sno
question,"The question what -- what -- I'm not sure what you would have us publish, I have in mind something I 1 like the Frank Statement that would have been published as an advertisement to smokers in newspapers around the country .",sno
answer,"No, I certainly do not think that would have been appropriate . M R. FINZEN: Would you mark this next, please . (Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1240 was marked for identification.)",n-d
question,"Mr. Spears, I'm now showing you what's been markcd as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1240. It is a Lorillard internal report bearing accession number 2199, title, ""A REVIEW OF ANIMAL STUDIES CONDUCTED AT BIO-RESEARCH CONSULTANTS INC, AND THE SLOAN-KETTERING MEMORIAL INSTITUTE"" submitted by Spears, A . W ., 2 dated May 25, 1966, bearing Bates numbers through 625 . You are the author of this document, sir?",bin-d
answer,I am .,y
question,Do you recall preparing this document?,bin
answer,"Generally, yes .",y
question,"And the second page of the document is in letter form addressed to Mr . J . E. Bennett, President of the Lorillard Company, and has the same date of May 25, 1996. Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,1966 .,sno
question,"I'm sorry, 1966 .",sno
answer,Yes .,y
question,"Is it true that -- that in the 19 -- the 1960s, that mouse skin-painting was the only known system to study smoke condensate as a human carcinogen?",bin-d
answer,"Not as a human carcinogen, as an animal carcinogen.",n-d
question,"At the bottom of the first page, about two-thirds of the way down, you say, ""However, it is the only known system which permits one to study cigarette smoke condensate as a possible human carcinogen . . . ."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
answer,"That's different from what you said, ""as a"" -- you said ""as a human carcinogen"" I believe .",so
question,". Leaving out the word ""possible,"" is that what you're saying?",bin-d
answer,Well obviously. But it's really a -- an animal carcinogen . The work is on animals .,sno
question,But that's not what you wrote .,sno
answer,"I did write ""possible human carcinogen .""",sno
question,Right. You made no reference to animal carcinogen .,sno
answer,"Well that should be obvious : it's animal studies. The subject is -- is, at the top of the page under ""Subject: A Review of Animal Studies"".",sno
question,"That's right. The ""it"" in that sentence, however, ""it"" refers to animal studies ; correct, mouse skin-painting?",bin-d
answer,Yes. Animal .,y
question,"So the answer to my question, it's true that in the 1960s mouse skin-painting was the only known 35PEARS.Y system to study smoke condensate as a human carcinogen, that's a true statement .",bin-d
answer,That is not a true statement .,n
question,"That's what you said here ; is it not, sir?",bin-d
answer,"No. I said ""possible .""",n-d
question,". So your -- your quarrel with me is failure to use the word ""possible"" in my question .",bin
answer,"Anything is possible, but it certainly was not ever considered a system to study human carcinogens .",sno
question,"You say at the beginning of this that ""During l 1 the past decade, the Research Division of P . Lorillard Company, Inc . has been investigating the tumorigenic properties of cigarette smoke condensate toward mouse epithelium through cooperative studies with Doctor Wynder, of the Sloan-Kettering Memorial Institute, and on a consulting basis with Bio-Research Consultants, Inc . ."" I 8 Are you referring there to the studies with Dr . Homburger as well?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, that's Bio-Research, the name of his organization .",y-d
question,Is one of the reasons that Lorillard was doing the studies of mouse skin-painting for the purpose of -- the commercial potential that would exist if a smoke fraction that was carcinogenic could be a discovered and removed?,bin
answer,"I think certainly that would have been a possibility if we had been able to isolate the compounds responsible and, in the future, believed that this was a -- a reliable bioassay in terms of the possibility of-- of being reflective of a human carcinogenic potential, but I think the basic motive was to follow up any of the accusations that were made against cigarette smoking in terms of our ability to experimentally look at it . So we were looking experimentally at the result that was produced and reported by Dr. Wynder to see if we could understand this result in terms of the composition of tobacco smoke .",sno
answer,Is it numbered page three?,bin
question,"Numbered page three at the top, yes. You describe terms like promoter and co-carcinogen in the context here of-- of the work that's been done . You say, ""The term, quote, promoter, close quote, or, quote, cocarcinogen, close quote, is used to describe the effect of certain chemicals which have no tumor-producing properties in total, but when used in conjunction with a twnorigenic agent, an enhanced total effect is noted. Figure 3 illustrates the results obtained when croton"" or croton --",bin-d
answer,"""Croton .""",sno
question,"""Croton ."" ""-- croton oil with a low concentration of benz(a)pyrene is applied to mouse epithelium . The benz(a)pyrene in this experiment is termed the, quote, initiator, close quote, parens, i .e., close parens, a, quote, cocarcinogen, close quote, applied at too low a concentration to produce tumors in the absence of a, quote, promoter, close quote, and the croton oil represents the, quote, promoter, period, close quote ."" Do you see that portion?",sno
answer,I do .,y
question,The work that was being done had discovered already concentrations of chemicals like benzpyrene which were initiators ; correct?,bin-d
answer,"Yes, low -- At this point in time benzpyrene was found in about one part per million of the smoke condensate, a level which is far too low to cause tumors .",y-d
question,"And -- and so the -- another -- Another purpose of the work, equally important, was to try to figure out if there were promoters as well in smoke condensate?",sno
answer,"Well that was the hypothesis . To try to explain a response without being able to identify specific carcinogens, the hypothesis was advanced that there may be in tobacco smoke compounds that produce this effect that is seen with croton oil .",sno
question,"And at the bottom of the page you say that ""The promoting properties of cigarette smoke may be illustrated by initiating with a low concentration of 1 a carcinogen and repeated application of cigarette smoke. The results of such experiments are shown in go figure 7, and it may be noted that tumors appear very early compared to data obtained without an initiator, and secondly, the slope of the curve is thought to be representative of a promoting effect ."" See that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"Is that evidence, then, from studies that had been done to show that there were indeed promoters in cigarette smoke?",bin
answer,"That was the interpretation of this kind of data, certainly, at that time .",sno
question,"And then over on to the next page, and continuing to discuss the fractionation work, you say, ""Fractionation of cigarette smoke into neutral, acidic, phenolic and basic portions followed by animal testing of each fraction for tumorigenicity has led to the conclusion that the neutral fraction is -- is highly tumorigenic . Further fractionation of the neutral portion and similar testing of the resulting fractions has yielded a fraction referred to as fraction B .""",bin-d
answer,"Yes, I see that .",y
question,"And were you able to conclude, then, that it was I I in part of the B fraction where promoters existed as well?",bin
answer,That was the belief at this juncture.,sno
question,"And at the bottom of the page, near the bottom ofpage four, you say, ""Subfraction B1, representing 0.5 percent of whole smoke, was found to be the only one which could be -- which could be promoted by croton oil . It, therefore, contains all of the carcinogens."" See that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,Was it also believed that there were promoters in the B 1 subfraction?,bin
answer,I don't think so .,n
question,"Then you go over on -- on to page five to discuss the -- more 1rnowledge about the subfraction. Near the top of the page you say, ""Of the known carcinogens in fraction B and fraction 131, benz(a)pyrene is well known .""",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"""From the curves shown in figures 6 and 8 it may be seen that 10 percent B fraction produces about the same tumorigenic response as .005 percent benz(a)pyrene. Using this data and the concentration of benz(a)pyrene found in fraction B, it may be estimated that fraction B is 13 times more active I 1 than can be expected from the concentration of benz(a)pyrene contained therein ."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"Is that 13 times more active evidence, then, of the fact that there are promoters working within that fraction as well?",bin
answer,"No . I think it's an indication that there are other initiators present, or complete carcinogens .",n-d
question,So that's more a realization or a recognition of the fact that you haven't found all of the possible initiators yet in that subfraction?,bin-d
answer,"That benzpyrene is not the only compound in that fraction that acts in the manner that benzpyrene acts, as a complete carcinogen or, when applied at -- at very low doses, as an initiator. You then say in the beginning of the next paragraph, ""It has been stated that fractions other than B must contain the promoting activity shown by whole smoke, and considerable effort has been expended to find fractions representative of this activity . Studies in the phenolic and acidic fractions indicated that some promoting activity is contained in both of these fractions . From the results it may be estimated that 25 percent of the total promoting effect is due to the compounds of I 1 these fractions."" Did you subsequently confirm other fractions in the smoke, other than the B fractions, that have promoters as well?",sno
question,"In the last page of the letter itself, page six at the top, in number five, numbered paragraph five, you say, ""The definition of the individual compounds responsible for the tumorigenic effect of cigarette smoke is far from complete, but the information gained in the last few years has clarified many aspects of the complex response of mouse epithelium to cigarette smoke. Continued investigation should ultimately give a definition of this response in terms of specific compounds of cigarette smoke ."" Did you continue on after May of 1966 with your mouse epithelium work?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, we did additional identification work and we -- as I recall, we made a synthetic mixture of the compounds that had been identified in tobacco smoke I I as either thought to be initiators or thought to be promoters and applied this to mouse skin and were able only to reproduce a very, very small part of the activity through -- through a combination of compounds that we had identified and had available to us as pure compounds. We have published, I guess, a number of papers that list the various ingredients that were identified .",y-d
question,Do you recall how many other promoters and initiators were -- were found in the subsequent work?,wh
answer,"Well I thinlc most of the compounds were identified by Dr . Hoffmann in Wynder's laboratory . As I said, his laboratory had chemists in it and -- who were working on this as well, and that they I have -- they have published . We found nothing which would add to what they had published .",sno
question,Do you recall how many additional promoters or initiators they found in their work?,wh
answer,"No, but it was a combination of, I guess, testing pure compounds and then looking to see if they were in tobacco smoke . Also many of the polycyclic compounds were present in things such as diesel exhaust, which they were looking at, and they would compare back and forth to these different materials. Separately individuals were studying polycyclic hydrocarbons in general for their tumorigenic effects. So it was a combination of many investigators looking at these different compounds, determining whether or not they were not carcinogens, and determining whether or not they were present in tobacco smoke. l8 Q. Theie were additional promoters or initiators ~ T -.119 found, however, in that work ; correct?",n-d
question,Was one of them NNN?,bin
answer,"No, it was not .",n
question,NNN was never found in cigarette smoke?,bin
answer,"Not with respect to this fractionation work, no .",n
question,"It -- it was, however, a component -- found to be a component of cigarette smoke; was it not?",bin-d
answer,"At -- at a later stage, yes. However, NNN does not produce a response on mouse skin .",y-d
question,NNN was not able to produce tumorigenic response on mouse skin?,bin
answer,It does not.,n
question,NNN is a known carcinogen; correct?,bin-d
question,Is it known to be a human carcinogen as well?,bin
answer,"No, it's not . It's a weak animal carcinogen actually .",n-d
question,"Do you know how many carcinogens have been identified today that exist or are able to be found in tobacco smoke, animal or human?",wh
answer,"To my understanding there are -- there may be no human, but the -- the group is essentially polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons and some nitrosamines .",sno
question,"And you say there may be no human, but again, we -- we can't test these compounds on humans ; correct?",bin-d
answer,"They have not been tested on humans, but sometimes you can reach the conclusion that they are human carcinogens because humans have been accidentally exposed to them .",sno
question,"Right. But outside of accidental exposure of some kind, certainly ethically you -- you can't test cancer-causing compounds on humans, correct?",bin-d
answer,"That's correct. But of course most of these polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons are present in air, so humans are being exposed to them continuously.",sno
question,"My question, however, is: You can't test these as you Would in animal tests to see whether or not they promote tumors in humans ; correct?",bin-d
answer,"No, you can't . You can't ethically test a suspect carcinogen by giving it to a human .",n-d
question,And so science is really relegated to doing animal studies and then trying to extrapolate that information to humans; correct?,bin-d
answer,"Scicuce is -- Part of science is to do -- develop proper 3srenxs .vi animal models to try to make extrapolations to humans, yes .",sno
question,And that's certainly what was being done with the mouse skin-painting activity ; correct?,bin-d
answer,"Well what was -- The mouse skin-painting activity was the result of an observation that you could produce tumors from cigarette smoke condensate on mouse skin at the maximum tolerated dose . Whether or not that relates to humans is unknown . I think many scientists will I 1 tell you that it's a very poor model in that it -- it's the wrong epithelium, the tumors are not like human tumors . There are many reasons to believe this -- this may not be and is probably not a good model at all .",sno
question,And most of those scientists are with the tobacco industry; correct?,bin-d
answer,"No, no, no .",n
answer,The National Toxicology Program is -- is beginning to abandon the idea of maximum tolerated doses as a proper means of screening chemicals for their carcinogenic effect.,sno
question,"There are many, many scientists that believe, however, that the mouse skin-painting is good science; isn't that correct?",bin-d
answer,". Principally the mouse skin-painting population of scientists, those who do inhalation work, would certainly say that that is the proper model .",sno
question,And the principal group that opposes the mouse skin-painting model are -- are those that either are -- reside in or work for the tobacco companies; correct?,sno
answer,"That's not correct . National Cancer Institute under the Tobacco Working Group had great doubts about this model but used it, and also spent an enormous amount of money trying to develop inhalation models .",sno
question,"Did Lorillard ever make a public pronouncement in an advertisement in a newspaper, with regard to any of their scientific work, that smoke product contained promoters and initiators for cancer?",bin
answer,"On mouse skin would have been the proper statement, but no, we did not make it .",n-d
question,Did Lorillard ever develop any new tests for carcinogenicity?,bin
answer,"No. Lorillard participated in some of the development of the technology that was used in inhalation work, but we did not specifically develop a new test .",n-d
question,Did Lorillard ever do research that attempted to relate human disease to smoking?,bin
answer,"I don't know what you mean by that, ""relate human disease to smoking ."" Lorillard sponsors, certainly, The Council for Tobacco Research ; Lorillard, certainly, participated in the Tobacco Working Group activities of the National Cancer Institute; Lorillard sponsored work at different institutions over time . That's the nature of the work that was done.",sno
question,Did Lorillard ever conduct experiments which required large doses of-- of carcinogens to show the additive effect of smoking?,bin
answer,"I'm sorry, what -- I'm not sure I understand what type of experiment you're talking about .",dno
question,Any type of experiments that required large doses of carcinogens to show the additive effect of smoking.,sno
answer,"Well I'm not sure the mouse skin-painting work that was for promoters was done in that way . You would add an initiator, either benzpyrene or some other initiator, and then apply a fraction of tobacco smoke following that . So I guess that meets your criteria, that type of experiment. But I'm not sure I understand the relevance of your question .",sno
question,"Showing you what's previously been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1526, this is a memorandum dated March 31, 1980 on Philip Morris letterhead .

question,"In this letter Mr . Seligman says that ""Mr. J . C . Bowling of our New York Office asked that I send you our recommendations for industry research which we prepared last year."" And then at the bottom of that first paragraph he says, ""Additionally, I have added a list of three subjects which I feel should be avoided."" See that?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, I do .",y
question,"Then on the last page he has a list of three items with a heading ""SUBJECTS TO BE AVOIDED ."" Subject one, ""Developing new tests for carcinogenicity . Number two, ""Attempt to relate human disease to smolting."" And number three, ""Conduct experiments which require large doses of carcinogen to show additive effect of smoking .""

question,There's some handwriting around that . Do you recognize that handwriting?,bin
answer,May be mine . I'm not sure .,dno
question,Do you -- Do you recall the items here that are listed as subjects to be avoided being a subject of discussion 1 in the committee?,bin
answer,"I can't be sure, but I -- I believe he maybe came and presented his thoughts to the committee .",dno
question,And is it a fair statement that the subjects to be avoided were kinds of tests that may very -- may very well be a stronger link or evidence of a stronger link between smoking and human disease?,bin
answer,"No. Developing new tests for carcinogenicity, for example, I would agree with him that there was so much activity going on in the scientific community with respect to this that I don't think we could have reasonably contribided anything . So I think just -- just from a knowledge of what was happening in the scientific community, that would -- to me was an appropriate recommendation .",n-d
question,"With the industry taking a fairly strong position that you can't extrapolate from mouse skin-painting or other animal tests to humans, why would the industry not be related -- interested in trying to attempt to relate human disease to smoking?",wh-d
answer,"I don't understand -- That basically would be more epidemiological work, and I would say that, again, the feeling that there was nothing to be learned by doing more epidemiology .",sno
question,Isn't it more accurate to say that the tobacco industry didn't want to have epidemiology done that confirmed the epidemiology of others and have it be either authored by or supported by the industry?,bin-d
answer,"No, I think the industry accepts the epidemiology that's been done, certainly accepts it today. We indicate that smoking is a risk factor.",n-d
question,Well the epidemiology concludes that it is a risk factor that has an enormous increase in the relative risk of cancer compared to non-smokers ; correct?,bin-d
answer,"Depends on the study, but certainly they -- there have been enough of them to conclude there's an elevated risk that I accept that statistical association and -- and the fact that it is a risk factor .",sno
question,"And in fact, as we discussed a few moments ago, the fact that you can't do ethically testing of carcinogens on humans, the -- the human experiment, if you will, that we have is to do epidemiological studies of smokers to determine whether or not there is an increased risk associated with smoking ; correct?",bin-d
answer,Correct .,y
question,"And in that sense, years and years and years of smoking is the experiment, is it not, for humans?",bin-d
answer,"Yes. But in this context he's saying enough of that work's been done, we're not going to learn anything by sponsoring more of it . Nothing unreasonable about that.",y-d
question,"In the third item about attempting to conduct experiments which require large doses of carcinogen to show additive effects of smoking, can you read the handwriting that's written next to that one? Does it say ""implantation?""",bin-d
answer,"I think it says ""implantation, et cetera .""",sno
question,Do you know what that refers to?,wh
answer,"What it would, I think -- I know what implantation would refer to, and that is basically you implant or instill into the animal large doses of a carcinogen and then follow it with tobacco smoke, and I would agree that's a meaning -- meaningless experiment .",sno
question,. Were there other types of research and testing that the industry agreed should not be done?,bin
question,What work did Lorillard do to remove potential disease-causing ingredients from smoke?,wh
answer,"Well we've done work throughout my career with the company that relate to removing particulate matter and other specific materials through filters, was the maj or part of it, reduction in particulate matter of cigarettes, development of selected filters.",sno
question,"Showing you now what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1241, it is a memorandum on Lorillard letterhead dated February 24, 1986 from you to Dr. F . J . Schultz, subject, ""Ingredients ."" Have you seen this before?",bin-d

answer,"Flavor Extract Manufacturers Association, I t believe .",so
question,They are the manufacturers of the -- of the compounds?,bin
answer,They're an organization of the flavor 5 manufacturers,sno
question,"And when you say ""flavors,"" you're referring to the things that are compounds on this chart?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, that's right . And of course the -- under ""FDA,"" they're approved for food use . And I presume 1""Poundage"" means the total poundage that Lorillard was using at that time --",y-d
answer,-- in all of its -- Total of everything .,sno
question,"In terms of the yesses, you believe, under the column ""FEMA"" and ""FDA,"" those stand for whether or not they've been approved for use in food products?",bin-d
answer,"Under ""FDA"" that's the case . Under ""FEMA,"" it would not be food products, but generally regarded as safc for use as flavorants, including many food products .",sno
question,"And that -- that FEMA work, however, had -- had been done with regard to additives in food products only; correct? They hadn't done work where the flavors were pyrolized as they would be in smoke ; had they?",bin-d
answer,"That's correct . But -- No, they're not necessarily pyrolized in smoke either .",y-d
question,"Many of them are, however, correct?",bin-d
answer,"No, many of them are not . It depends on the structure and the volatility of the material . Many of them transfer intact, particularly those that are volatile, and many of the flavors are volatile . 35PLARS.VI",n-d
question,". Had -- As of February of 1986, to your knowledge, had anybody done testing of these compounds where they were in a pyrolysis product of any kind and approved them for that purpose, either -- either FEMA or FDA?",bin-d
answer,"To my knowledge, neither FEMA nor FDA was considering pyrolysis .",sno
question,". And am I reading correctly that with something like number two, butyraldehyde, that that was possibly toxic by inhalation, and mutagenic ; is that right?",bin-d
answer,"There -- there would have been something in the literature. Whether it was valid or not was not a consideration, just that it would appear in the literature anything negative about a compound, or would appear in the press anything negative, it would appear, I think, under this problem . No evaluation as to whether it was true or not .",sno
question,"Despite the existence of those possible problems in the literature, there was no intent on the part of Lorillard as of February of 1986 to remove -- to remove butyraldehyde from the product?",bin
answer,"I would have to look back through all of our records, but I -- I don't -- I don't know .",dno
question,"Do you recall any time when Lorillard advised the smokers of its -- of its products that there were compounds added lhat were reported in any media, scientific or otherwise, as being possible mutagens or carcinogens contained within the product?",bin
answer,"Well of -- of -- In this context we would be reporting, you'd be asking the food manufacturers and the FDA, I guess, to report the same thing to the public . I think that's totally inappropriate. These are not known facts, these arc reports . There may be conflicting reports in the literature . You'd have to do a total -- a total review. And when we do the total reviews, we'd decide whether or not we would continue to use the material or not.",sno
question,"Well when you go to the food store and you pick a pack of cookies off the shelf, you can read all of the ingredients as a consumer that are in those cookies ; correct?",bin-d
answer,"Incorrect. You'll see flavorants, and there's no description what the flavorants are .",n-d
question,Is there a list of any ingredients of any kind that are contained on a cigarette pack?,bin
answer,Not on a cigarette pack .,n-d
question,"And so unlikc consumers of other food products, unless Lorillard makes an effort to publicize the flavorants or the compounds that are in the products, consumers of your cigarettes have no way of knowing what ingredients they are -- they are consuming ; correct?",bin-d
answer,Same thing is true of the food products .,sno
question,Same thing is true of the food products?,bin
answer,"Yes. You have a limited list of ingredients that are in foods, but you don't know what flavorants and colorants are, which where -- is where all of these kind of materials would be under the food labeling .",y-d
question,"There is not even a limited list of ingredients on a cigarette paclc, though ; is there?",bin-d
answer,There has been no list . There has been complete S disclosure of a list to the federal government repeatedly over time .,sno
question,"And my question to you, sir, is : Did Lorillard ever advise the smokers of its products that there were compounds contained within those products that were identified in any literature as being possible mutagens or carcinogens?",bin
answer,"I'm trying to answer your question . Lorillard and the other manufacturers did disclose to the public a list of all ingredients that were used in tobacco as of a date back -- I guess 1994 maybe . Other than that, there has been no disclosure that I'm aware of other than scientific articles that have indicated various things are being used as flavorants in the tobacco industry .",sno
question,And you're referring to the list of ingredients that went to the HHS?,bin
answer,That's correct .,y
question,"And that list of ingredients is not generally available to the public ; is it, sir?",bin-d
answer,"I just explained to you that that list of ingredients was made to the public in 1994, I believe .",so
question,It was made to the HHS .,sno
answer,"No, sir, it was made available to the public .",n
question,Where?,wh
answer,With a press release to the general public . The -- the list was released .,sno
question,How many ingredients are on that list?,wh
answer,Five hundred ninety sonie as I recall .,sno
question,And there isn't one that's identified with any particular manufacturer ; is there?,bin-d
answer,They're not identified by brand or by manufacturer .,sno
question,"So my question again is: As to this date, has Lorillard ever advised the consumer of -- consumers of its cigarettes what the ingredients are that they are getting when they smoke a Lorillard cigarette?",bin
answer,The answer is no . And the same is true for anyone who buys a food product .,n-d
question,And the same is true for anyone who buys any other tobacco product as well . There's no public disclosure of what ingredients they are getting ; correct?,bin-d
answer,"Unless you -- unless you want to not consider tar and nicotine as ingredients . There is a disclosure of the FTC yield of carbon monoxide, nicotine and tar .",sno
question,"Mr. Spears, are -- are you familiar with the statistics concerning the age at which most smokers begin smoking?",bin
answer,"I'm familiar with the government statistics, or government reports I guess .",sno
question,. Then you're aware that the govenunent reports show that approximately 66 percent of all smokers began smoking before the age of 18?,bin
answer,"I don't remember the precise number, but a large majority, yes .",dno
question,And that less than five percent of all smokers ever start after the age of 24?,bin
answer,Generally those are the numbers that I recall .,sno
question,And that the renewal of the market stems almost entirely from younger smokers?,bin
answer,That statem ent has been made .,sno
question,Do you believe that to be an accurate statement?,bin
answer,Well it's based on that information .,sno
question,And that these younger smokers are the only source of replacement smokers . Do you believe that's an accurate statcment?,bin-d
answer,"Well obviously I don't -- I'm not sure I understand what you mean by ""younger smokers,"" but less than 18 years of age?",nu
question,Beginners. Let's refer to them that way. The beginning smokers are the only source of replacement smokers .,sno
answer,"Oh, I think people quit and restart . I've certainly known people who have quit smoking and then restarted . I don't know what percentage they are .",dno
question,"But overall, in terms of the replacement for people who quit and die, the beginner smokers are the real source of replacement of those individuals for the industry ; are they not?",bin-d
answer,"People who ure dying who are smokers, obviously there have to be smokers from some source to replace them or the market will decrease, if-- if we're talking about number of smokers .",sno
question,"And those statistics you refer to as being government statistics about the number of people who began smoking below the age of 18, Lorillard had data internally as wcll that confirmed that ; correct, showing that there were millions of youth under the age of 17 that were smoking?",bin-d
answer,I think Lori I lard had some data that there are younger smokers . I don't think we ever had any -- 1 don't recall ever seeing a document that estimated the number.,sno
question,"I'm showing you now, sir, what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1242 . It is a memorandum on Lorillard letterhead dated November 25, 1981 from Laurie Moroz or Moroz, M-o-r-o-z, to J . R. Ave, subject, ""Smoke Incidence by Age Group,"" bears Bates number 03926040 through 042 . Have you seen this document before?",bin-d
answer,I'm not sure. I don't recall it at the moment .,dno
question,I believe you've identified for the record already J . R. Ave from prior documents .,so
answer,Yes .,y
question,Who is Laurie Moroz?,wh
answer,I believe she was a person in the marketing research department .,so
question,"And the copied individuals, J. G . Flinn and T . H. Mau, do you know those individuals?",bin
answer,"Flimi I identified previously as director of marketing research, and Mau was in marketing or advertising .",sno
question,"And the memorandum begins by saying, ""Attached are estimates for the number of smokers within eleven different age groups for total population, males, and females ."" See that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"And then you look at the two attached pages . The first page, it would be the second page of the memorandum, is -- appears to be all smokers of age, not broken down by male or female, for smoker population 13 plus years . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,". This would indicate, if I'm reading this correctly, in the first grouping, which is ages 13 to 17, that there were in the far right-hand column, which lists number of smokers in that age group, 2,175,000 . Am I reading that correctly?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, you are .",y
question,"And then in the middle column there is an estimate -- an attempt to determine what percentage of the total population that that number represents ; is that correct? Or not -- I'm sorry. Or is that the total population that that number represents in the country, period?",bin-d
answer,I believe it's in the country . Percent of population 13 plus years .,so
question,"So 1 .2 percent of all of the population in the country was aged 13 plus years, or the smokers? Do you understand what that column is purporting to say?",wh-d
answer,I'm not sure what the middle column means.,dno
question,"The first columm next to the age grouping says ""Percent of Smokers ."" That would seem to indicate what percent that group represents of all smokers?",wh-d
answer,"I would -- Yes, that's my conclusion of that title, yes .",y-d
question,Is a reasonable conclusion of the middle column the percent of the total population of 13- to 17-year-old individuals that -- that the smokers comprise?,bin-d
answer,"I think so, but I can't be a hundred percent sure .",dno
question,Had you seen information of this kind published in any other Lorillard documents before November of 1981?,bin
answer,"No . But this is the government statistics, I think, that I referred to, that I was aware that there were government statistics. At least they indicate that's the source of this information.",n-d
question,Were you aware of the govenuuent statistics from sources outside of Lorillard prior to November of 1981?,bin
answer,"Not -- not in detail, but I was generally aware that the government had published the number of smokers by age groups .",n-d
question,Has Lorillard ever done a study to -- to determine how many youth under age 18 smoke its products?,wh
answer,"I thit Ic there's been incidental information, but I don't recall a specific study, no .",n-d
question,I think at the beginning of the deposition I I I asked you what your largest-selling brand is and you told me that it was Newport .,sno
answer,That's correct .,y
question,Newport has been an extremely popular brand among young smokers under age 18 ; isn't that correct?,bin-d
answer,It's one of the brands that has relatively young demographics .,sno
question,And that's -- that's not by accident ; is it? From the beginning hasn't Newport been marketed as a fun cigarette and aimed at a youthCul market?,bin-d
answer,"It's never been aimed at a market under the legal age of smoking in terms of Lorillard's strategy, no .",n-d
question,But has it been aimed at a youthful market?,bin
answer,"Well what -- I don't know what you mean by ""youthful,"" but it's -- it's not been aimed specifically at anyone . It's been aimed at the smoker franchise, including the younger demographics in the smoker franchise, the legal smoker franchise .",sno
question,"Showing you now, sir, what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1243, it is a memorandum on Lorillard letterhead, General Office, New York, dated September 15, 1964, from M . Yellen to M.

answer,"Yes, it is .",y
question,Do you recall the first time that you saw this document?,bin
answer,In preparation for this deposition .,sno
question,"This document appears to be a memorandum regarding Lorillard's sales position, is the subject. Mr. Cramer is listed as the president and CEO of the company as of September 1964 . Do you Imow who M. Yellen is'?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, I do .",y
question,Who is that?,wh
answer,I believe he was the sales vice-president or sales director . Probably sales director at this time .,so
question,"And in this memorandum he reviews the sales position on a number of Lorillard products, and at page six he addresses Newport. Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"And he says, about the middle o f the page in the third full paragraph near the end, "" We had to sell a, quote, certain type, close quote, of person on the brand of NEWPORT until such time as we could establish sufficient volume to make the brand profitable and then gradually change our image to obtain, quote, other types of smokers, close quote, period . ""The brand was marketed as a, quote, fun cigarette, close quote . It was advertised as such and obtained a youthful group as woll as an immature group of smokers."" See that?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"Were you aware at about the mid-1960s, when this was being written, that Lorillard had at that time attracted a youthful and immature group of smokers?",bin
answer,No .,n
question,When is the first time that that became known to you?,wh
answer,"Well as I recall at this time, Newport was struggling to have a significant presence in the marketplace, I don't remember what its sales volume was but it was relatively small, and later almost had a significant sales reversal, in other words, declining sales, and then later turned around . But--",dno
question,"And it was as a result of this early effort to make this a fun cigarette and advertise it to, as such, the youthful and immature group that it attracted that made it -- made the base of Lorillard's business the high-school student ; correct?",bin-d
answer,"I don't kmow that . I certainly wouldn't concludes that that's what lie means by ""immature group."" I don't know what he means by those words .",sno
question,"Well it--it-- It was reported as such, was it not, by -- in 1978, that the base of Lorillard's business in Newport is the high-school student?",bin-d
answer,It was reported when?,wh
question,In 1978 .,sno
answer,"I saw a memo -- I have seen a memo that makes that statement. But again I have no definition what ""base"" means. It certainly wasn't a significant volume .",sno
question,"Showing you now what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1244, it is a memorandum on Lorillard letterhead from T . L. Achey or Achey, A-c-h-e-y, to Mr. Curtis Judge, dated August 30, 1978, bearing Bates stamp number 03537131 through 7132 . Have you seen this memorandum before?",bin-d
answer,I have .,y
question,And in August of 1978 was Curtis Judge the presidcnt of Lorillard?,bin
answer,"Yes, he was .",y
question,And do you know who T . L. -- is it Achey or Achey?,or
answer,Achey .,sno
question,Achey. Do you know who T. L. Achey is?,bin
answer,"I think he was a-- I'm not sure exactly what his capacity was in the sales organization, but lie was a field sales individual out in the field .",dno
question,"And the subject of this memo is just identified as ""Product Lifonnation,"" and he says in the third paragraph, ""The success of NEWPORT has been fantastic during the past few years . Our profile taken locally shows this brand being purchased by black people, parens, all ages, close parens, young adults, parens, usually college age, close parens, but the base of our business is the high school student ."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,Were you a vice-president by August of 1978?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,"Did you ever recall a time in your interactions with Curtis Judge when he came to you and said, ""You know, I'm really concerned . I've --1've found out that one of our products has a basc of business in under-age smokers?""",bin
answer,No .,n
question,Is that something you would have expected him to share with you i f it was a subject that troubled him?,bin
answer,"I think ifhe Qrought it was signiCicant, he would have indicated that to tne .",sno
question,"Hc says -- Achey says in the next paragraph, ""NEWPORT in the 1970's is tuming into the Marlboro of the 60's and 70's. It is the, quote, In, close quote, brand to smoke if you want to be one of the group ."" Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"Was Newport advertising, to your knowledge, aimed generally at making Newport appear to be the in cigarette among a group of friends or individuals?",bin
answer,No . The Newport advertising has been consistent over the years ; same type of advertising that it is today .,n-d
question,Did that advertising rely to a great extent upon peer acceptance?,bin
answer,"I think pcer pressure is probably importantin terms of what an individual smokes . I think it's -- You know, what their parents smoke has a bearing on it in tenns oCaccess to cigarettes, this sort of thing. So I think if a brand is generally popular among a part of the population, it extends to the younger ages .",sno
question,And did Lorillard attempt to capitalize on that phenomenon by having the ads exert peer acceptance and peer pressure?,bin
answer,No. I said the ads were similar to what they are today.,n-d
question,"He goes on to say, ""Our problem is the younger consumer that does not desire a menthol cigarette . If that person desires a non-uicnthoi, hut wants to be part of the, quote, In group, close quote, he goes to Marlboro . ""Could we be furnishing a back-lash to Marlboro from our NEWPORT brands, question mark."" He then goes on and suggests the development of a-- an additional product, an extension of Newport into a non-menthol product ; correct?",bin-d
answer,Correct .,y
question,Was that concept something that was ever considered by Lorillard?,bin
answer,Yes .,y
question,. Was a non-menthol Newport product ever either developed or tested or put on the market?,bin
answer,Yes .,y
question,For what period of time?,wh
answer,"I think it was -- I can't remember how far the distribution went and whether it went national or whether it was a major test market, but the brand was called Newport Red .",dno
answer,And it was a failure .,sno
question,It never reached a full-scale commercial market; did it?,bin
answer,"I'm not sure, but it certainly didn't generate sales to the point where it was a viable brand . It was discontinued .",dno
answer,Mr. Achey must have been wrong .,sno
question,There are other internal documents that show that Lorillard has confirmed the young starting age of smokers in some of the studies that it has done as well; isn't that true?,bin-d
answer,"I think that we're aware that there are under-age smokers, if -- if that's your question . I'm not sure what documents you're referring to .",sno
question,"Showing you now, sir, what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1245, it's entitled ""An Exploratory Study for Newport, SMOKING AND PURCHASE BEHAVIOR OF YOUNG ADULTS,"" conducted for Lorillard, 3 October 1981, and it bears Bates numbers through 689 . Have you seen this document before?",bin-d
answer,I think so .,so
question,And the persons conducting this study appear to be shoi balaban dickinson research'?,bin
answer,"-- first page, yes .",incomplete
question,Their name appears in the lower le$ of the cover page .,sno
answer,"Yes, it does .",y
question,Is that a research group that you're familiar with?,bin
answer,"I think I-- I know the name, yes . I'm not terribly familiar with them, but I recognize the name .",y-d
question,"Have -- Have they done other work, research work for Lorillard over the years?",bin
answer,I think they have .,so
question,"In this particular research, if you turn to it's the fourth page of the document, to numbered page one at the bottom of the page, ""Foreward"" at the top, it says, ""The objectives of the study have been to investigate: ""Smoking and purchase behavior of young men and women"" -- I'm sorry, let me start again . ""Smoking and purchase behavior of young men and young women 18 to 24 years of age, with special emphasis on young adults who smoke Newport Green and Marlboro."" And then secondly, ""Peer group attitudes related to smoking and the effects of peer group on brand selection."" And then thirdly, ""Exposure to media and recall of advertising ."" And they reflect two groups of women aged 18 to 24 and two groups of men aged 18 to 24 with, I believe, a total numbor ofparticipants of 32, if you go to the back of the report, second-to-the-last page where they give background characteristics of the respondents. See that?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, I do .",y
question,Appears to be a total respondents of 32 in this study?,bin
answer,Yes.,y
question,. They did this in interview sessions with the individuals ; correct?,bin-d
answer,Hmm. I'd have to look at it as to what they did .,sno
answer,Yes. These were focus -- so-called focus groups .,y-d
question,"If you turn to page five, at the bottom of the page, the first -- this is in -- under the summary of their findings, but at the top of the page they say, ""Three out of four respondents have been smoking their current brand for several years . These young adults evidence strong brand preference and loyalty . Adoption of current brand was very often motivated by a desire to smoke the same brand as a close friend or friends."" See that?",bin-d
answer,Yes. That's what I indicated carlier.,y-d
question,"Right. That that -- That's something that Lorillard already knew . This wasn't new information; correct, that young people are very strongly brand loyal?",bin-d
answer,"Well I don't -- I don't know that 32 people provide you very much information on that, it's just within this group of 32, and if you N~ anted to follow up on that, you would conduct a much larger study .",sno
question,"Did you already know, however, at Lorillard, by this time, that young people were strongly brand loyal, not -- not just this group, but young people generally were?",bin
answer,"I don't know how much we knew about brand loyalty. I think we certainly knew that -- and believed, at least I did, that many people smoked the brands that are smoked by their peers and/or their parents .",dno
question,"And then in the third paragraph on page five they say, ""One-half of these respondents began to smoke at ages 10 to 13 years, with most of the remainder starting to smoke berivccn 14 to 17 years of age, with the pattern precisely equal between male and female respondents. Among these participants, it 19 was rare to start smoking at an age older than years."" See that?",bin-d
answer,I see that .,y
question,"And again, that -- that confirmed the government statistics that Lorillard was already aware of, that people beyond the age of 18 who were smokers, the largc majority of them started before the age of 18 ; correct?",bin-d
answer,"I would say it a different way . I would say this is consistent with what the government has indicated. However, this is an extraordinarily small study, with 32 subjects .",sno
question,"They also say in the next paragraph, ""Marlboro and Newport were mentioned far more often than any other brands as the initial brand smoked."" And then sticking with the initial brand, in the last sentence of that paragraph they say, ""The initial brand smoked was almost always the same brand used by a family member or friends, with friends cited far more often as smoking the initial brand ."" See that?",bin-d
answer,Consistent with what I just said .,sno
question,"But within that consistent statement, it is true, is it not, that the peer influence of friends was known to be a much greater influence than that of fami ly or other adults?",bin-d
answer,I'm not sure.,dno
question,"On the next page, top of page six, in the second parasraph -- find that? Second paragraph, first sentence says, ""Discussion of response to various types of promotional cfforts shows these young smokers to be quite um-esponsive - a reflection of their loyalty to current brand .""",bin-d
answer,1 see that .,sno
question,". Again it was relatively well known -- well lrnown by this time at Lorillard, was it not, that young people in particular, but smokers in general, tended to be quite brand loyal?",bin
answer,"That's what this data says . And as I say, it's, 1 think, consistent with -- with what the government has indicated . But certainly I wouldn't call this study the definitive one . I consider -- consider it to be consistent with larger studies .",sno
question,I-Iad -- Had you seen statistics that indicated the percentage of smokers each year that were true switchers amounted to only three to four percent of smokers?,bin
answer,"I think it depends on what poinu in history you're looking at the switching data . I've seen switehing data much higher than that during the period of time that there were man% brand extensions coming into tlie marketplace with lower tar/nicotine numbers, for example, so it depends on when in history you're looking at it . Brand switching, I thinlc, varies, from what I've seen, from maybe as high as 15 or 16 percent down to this two or three percent .",sno
question,"And if you did some kind of a retrospective surncy looking at a median number, would it be low, at closer to that three to four percent than at the range at the higher end of 15 percent?",bin-d
answer,"I -- I don't think you -- I don't think there is such a thing as a median number that means anything . As I say, it depends . If there are no alternatives in the marketplace, you're not going to get as much switching as if there is. For example, when price brands, lower-price brands came iii the marketplace, I'm sure that there was large switching rates . So it depends, really, on what is happening in the marketplace as to what the switching rates are .",n-d
question,Does the cvidence that -- that N% e have seen here that Lorillard has as its most successful brand a brand that is bought by a large number of under-age smokers make you angry?,bin-d
answer,By a large number of under-age smokers make me angry?,nu
question,Yes .,y
answer,No . I have no control over what individual behavior is . Doesn't make me angry .,n-d
question,". As the CEO of the company today, does it concern you that it has been reported that the base of your business of the most popular brand you have are under-age smokers?",bin-d
answer,"The fact that it's been reported doesn't bother me at all. I think it has to be considcred in the meaning of the -- the meaning of the word . And certainly there is not a significant number of Lorillard smokers that are in this under-age group in terms of the total franchise . And certainly we do I I not market to these individuals, and what habits they have are determined by their parents and their -- presumably their peers, as we've seen, out of the control of Lorillard. We have certainly tried to discourage with progrmns through The Tobacco Institute the use of cigarettes by those under age, including some inCormation to parents on how they should respond to questions raised by early teenagers .",sno
question,Well the tobacco industry has repeatedly said that it does not want young people to smoke ; correct?,bin-d
answer,That's correct.,y
question,And they've done that through industry organizations like The Tobacco Institute?,bin
answer,That's correct.,y
question,And The Tobacco Institute has taken that position publicly for ycars ; is that correct?,bin-d
answer,"Yes, it has .",y
question,"Showing you now, Mr . Spears, what's been marked as Pluintiffs' Exhibit 1246, it is -- appears to be an advertisement . It says ""TED BATES & COMPANY Advertising"" at the top, it says ""COPY DEPARTMENT,"" and it says ""CLIENT : TOBACCO INSTITUTE"" on the left-hand side near the top, and it's dated 11/29i67. It bears Bates number MNAT00387159 . Have you seen this document before?",bin-d
answer,I don't recall it .,dno
question,Have you seen advertisements on behalf of The Tobacco Institute of this kind bearing copy of the kind that is shown on Exhibit 1246?,bin
answer,"No, I haven't seen. Or if I have, I don't recall this type of copy .",n-d
question,Have you seen publications by The Tobacco Institute as advertisements to the public in which they said cigarette makers believe the decision to smoke or to not smoke must be an adult judgment?,bin-d
answer,"What I recall seeing are materials that were provided as educational materials out of The Tobacco Institute to reach patients, materials in terms of restricting purchasing, the We Card program it's referred to, through retailer -- in cooperation with retailer organizations, these kinds of materials .",sno
question,"Do you recall seeing Tobacco Institute advertisements to the public in the 1960s, however, saying that The Tobacco Institute aud the cigarette manufacturers believed that smoking is -- is an adult custout?",bin-d
answer,I don't recall one way or the other .,dno
question,". And that as the bottom paragraph of this copy states, ""The cigarette makers urge our young people not to smoke. . .not to touch a cigarette until they can make a more responsible decision .""",sno
answer,I say I don't recall one way or the other in terms of this time period .,dno
question,"At later time periods do you recall seeing Tobacco Institute advertisements that made those stutenients, that smol :in- is an adult custom and that the tobacco manufacturers urged young people not to smoke'?",bin
answer,What I recall are the kinds of materials I've just described earlier .,sno
question,. Do you have any reason to believe that The Tobacco Institute was not putting out advertisements of this kind in the mid-1960s?,bin
answer,". No, I don't -- I don't know .",dno

question,"If these kinds of statements were being made by The Tobacco Institute in the mid-1960s, and I-- and I understand you're saying ""I -- I just don't know one way or the other,"" but my question is if -- assuming they were being made, whether Lorillard was a part of The Tobacco lnstitute or not, would Lorillard have adopted this as aa conect position with regard to young people smoking?",bin-d
answer,That they don't want under-age individuals to smoke?,nu
question,Yes .,y
answer,"I would think so. We have to change tape . Off the record, please .",sno
question,"Giveithepositionoftheindustrythroughout time, and I think -- Is that a fair statement, throughout all periods of time, the 1950s through today, that they've taken the position that young people, under-age people should not smoke?",bin-d
answer,". Certainly is today, and my belief is that they've taken that position throughout history .",sno
question,"Given that position, can you explain how it is that The Tobacco Institute vigorously opposed bills that were pending in the legislature of the state of Minnesota in 1965 that were intended to prohibit persons under the age of 18 from using tobacco?",wh
answer,"Well without knowing the full context of the bill, I couldn't even offer an opinion .",sno
question,"This is a document on letterhead of The Tobacco Institute, Inc . in Washington, D .C., dated February 4, 1965, and it's to The Tobacco Institute membership from Frank J.

question,Do you know who Frank Welch is?,wh
answer,"No, I do not.",n
question,"This document says in the introductory paragraph, ""This is a progress report on bills pertaining to tobacco, other than tax bills, that have been introduced in the indicated respective legislatures and current statutes of-- status of each of those bills .

answer,Yes .,y

answer,I do .,y
question,"At this point in time, 1965, you were aware that The Tobacco Institute was doing legislative lobbying both at Congress and in the states?",bin
answer,That's been its purpose .,sno
question,. And as part of that legislative lobbying it sought to influence legislation that was either felt to be favorable to the industry or to oppose legislation that it was felt to be unfavorable to the industry; isn't that correct?,bin-d
answer,Or there may be other contexts besides just those two in terms of favoring or opposing .,sno
question,"Turn, if you would, please, to the third page of this document, Bates nu nber -- last three numbers are 23 -- 2363 . Do you have that?",bin-d
answer,"Yes, I do .",y
question,"At the bottom of the page there is the list of the five bills pending in Minnesota . The first one was 1197 by Farmer, to Health & Welfare, and it says ""Relating to penalties for permitting tobacco to be used by persons under age 18 ."" And then it has a Senatc-side version S 301, by Anderson, to General Legislation, same as H 97 . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,. I do .,y
question,". It's absolutely inconsistent, is it not, to be urging young people not to smoke and at the same time opposing states who are trying to legislate acts that would enforce that and keep tmder-age smokers from smokiug?",bin-d
answer,"I don't believe so . I don't think there's inconsistency necessarily. It depends on what -- what the bill says and what it's doing . If it's, for example, turning all people into criminals who are caught using a cigarette, I would oppose that . Depends on what the bill says .",n-d
question,"At a bare minimum, would you agree that it -- it makcs the advertisements urging young people not to smokc fairly hollow?",bin
answer,"No, I would not. Without laiowing what was in the bill and why it was being opposed, I wouldn't reach uny conclusion without that kind of infomiation .",n-d
question,"Well it wasn't only the Minnesota legislature that had bills pertaining to youth smoking that were bcing opposed by The Tobacco Institute in this memorandum. Turn, if you would, to page two under -- about the middle of the page, Michigan . Item number two, ""A bill to ban smoking in the public schools and at state universities ."" The Tobacco Institute was also opposing that .",sno
answer,". Does that include adults? That's a question that you should answer bcforc you say what position would you take . If it included adults, I'd be opposed .",wh-d
question,"Could you turn to the next page . At the top of Qre page, California, Assembly Bi11595, by Donovan, ""prov ides that any person under 18 may not possess tobacco and makes it a misdemeanor to do so ."" They were opposing that bill as well .",bin-d
answer,". 1 f that's -- TCthatwasthefulleontentofthebill,thenl would not know why they would oppose it .",sno
question,"And below that, Massachusetts, 11265, by Brett, to Public Health . A- But these are one-sentence descriptions of a bill; hardly indicates everything that's in the bill .",sno
answer,"I don't know . Certainly public school materials have had information on smoking for a long period of timc in all of the texts that are used . I don't -- I dori t know the purpose of this bill relative to other materials that may have been used . So again, without the full context, I can't comment .",dno
question,Was it one of the purposes of saying that young people shouldn't people the belief that at the youthful age they didn't have enough wisdom and judgment and education and background to make an informed decision about whethcr smoking was the right thing to do or not?,qo
answer,That's correct .,y
question,And wouldn't you then expect that The Tobacco Institute would support efforts to try to get that kind of information and education to young people so that they could make that decision intelligently and in an informed way when they reached the age of majority?,bin-d
answer,"If that were the only item in the bill, I would think that your statement is correct, but I don't lrnow that that's the case.",sno
answer,"Same comments . I-- you're giving me one-liners of all these bills, and I say this is not -- you cati t make a judgment based on a one-liner .",sno
question,"Did Lorillard ever go to The Tobacco Institute and suggest that they not lobby against bills that were of the type we've looked at, intended to keep under-age smokers from smoking?",bin
answer,I don't know one way or the other .,dno

answer,Only through The Tobacco Institute that I'm awarc of.,sno
question,"Are you aware that in 1979 the Secretary of Ilealth, Education & Welfare, Joseph Califano, called upon the tobacco industry to devote a reasonable portion of each company's advertising budget to a speciat campaign aimed at teenagers and children, emphasizing that smoking is not for children?",bin-d
answer,"Well as I say, there have been programs through The Tobacco Institute that are precisely aimed at those things .",sno
question,". Showing you now, sir, what's bccn marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1248, it is a two-page document that has a first page with a list of names on it, a second page that is a letter on the letterhead of the Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare, Washington, D.C ., below that the date of April 26, 1979, to the right of that the date of Apri130, 1979, and it is a I letter from Joseph A .

answer,I do not recall it .,dno
question,"Do you recall during the limeframe of the spring of 1979 there being a request made by the Secretary of Health, Education & Welfare, Mr. Califano, to the tobacco industry, requesting a contribution towards a campaign to educate children about not smoking?",bin

question,"Mr. Califano writes in this letter on the first parag-aph, ""According to a survey of the National Institutu of Education, there are now in America 1 .7 25 million girls and 1 .6 million boys between 12 and years of age who are regular cigarette smokers . When children under 12 and 19-year olds are added, the 3 number of teen and sub-teen smokers exceeds million ."" Are those numbers consistent with what you understood the numbers to be in that timeframe of government statistics on undcr-age smokers?",bin-d
answer,Well the 19 would not have been under-age smokers . As I recall the -- the under-age was always considered 18 -- less than 18 . So -- I mean I don't know whether -- I have no recollection of this letter or these statistics at that point in time .,sno
question,"In the third paragraph the secretary writes, ""I aui urging you and your colleagues to devote a reasonable portion of your advertising budgets to a special campaign aimed at teenagers and children, emphasizing that smoking is not for children ."" See that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"And lie then says in the -- in the final -- in the second-to-the-final paragraph, I guess, that he has made a talk that day in San Francisco, he says, "" . . .I suggested that ten percent of your industry's present advertising and promotion budget -- estimated upwards of 800 million -- would be a reasonable investment for you to make in the health of America's children ."" Did, to your knowledge, Lorillard contribute, in response to this campaign, any portion of its advertising budget towards a program to educate children, emphasizing that smoking is not for children?",bin-d
answer,"I would not be able to identify anything as a percentage of -- or as a part of our advertising budget, but as I indicated to you before, the programs that I'm fimi]iar with are those that came through The Tobacco Institute .",sno
question,". Do you know how much Lorillard spends on advertising, promotion and marketing per year?",wh
answer,"Depends on which year you're talking about, but--",incomplete
question,"In -- Let's take the most recent completed year, 1996 .",sno
answer,"Oh, I would say the order of 200 million dollars .",sno
question,Do you know how much Lorillard spent on youth prc;ventiai in the same year?,wh
answer,"No . But, as I've indicated to you, we have participated in the Tobacco Institute programs, and I don't know how much they have expended specifically on those programs .",n-d
question,. Let me show you a document that's previously been marked in this litigation as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 602A.,sno
question,"I'm showing you now what has previously been marked as Exhibit 602A. It is a report from Houlihan, Lokcy, Howard & Zukin in the State of Minncsola/Blue Cross Blue Shield litigation, an expert report by Paul Much, and I would ask you if you -- if you would, please, to turn to tab --",sno
answer,I don't have tabs .,sno
question,". Oh, I'm sorry. Then let me -- let me see if I can find that. Without tabs it's a little diCCtcult. I thought there was going to be one for the witness . Hold on a minute .",sno
question,"I have opened to a page that in the upper left says ""Advertising, R&D and Youth Prevention,"" in the upper left, and then it lists inforniation in the lower half of the -- of the page for Lorillard . Do you see that?",bin-d

question,"And then across the top, i f it's not covered, are dates .",sno
answer,I see them .,y
question,"And I would call your attention to the bottom of the chart on Lorillard that lists advertising, marketing and promotion expenditures, and then below that youth prevention expenditures .",sno
answer,. Yes .,y
question,". And will represent to you that the numbers that are contained in these charts are numbers that were provided to us in discovery in this case from Lorillard as being the advertising, marketing and promotion and youth prevention expenditure figures for years in which the company had them .",sno
answer,All right .,ack
question,"All right? And it purports to list them -- them across a span of years from 1954, if you page forward, through 1994, and then at the end it totals thc v under 1954 to 1994 . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,". Yes, I do .",y
question,"And what this shows on the page where the total for 1954 to 1994 is shown, that during that time span of -- of 40 years, Lorillard spent on advertising, mad<eting and promotion expenditures $4,773,843,387 . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"And on the youth prevention line at the bottom there are two columns, one for youth prevention expenditures and the second for youth prevention expenditures through The Tobacco Institute, through TI. Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"And if you look back over the preceding pages you'll see, I believe, that the first time figures for youth prevention expenditures show up is 1983 .",sno
answer,Yes.,y
question,And that tl ey are thereafter shown every year through 1994 in the column marked youth prevention expenditures through TL You see that?,bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"And is that consistent with what your 35PEARS.V1 understanding is, and as you've testified here today, that you have been a contributor to youth prevention programs through TI and -- and only through TI7",bin-d
answer,"That's what I said, yes .",y
question,"And ifyou turn back, then, to the summary page, at the 1954 to 1994 summary it shows that the total amount spent in youth prevention through The Tobacco Institute by Lorillard is $1,335,511 . See that?",bin-d
answer,". Lorillard's share, yes .",y-d
question,"That's correct . That's what I'm saying, the amount that Lorillard contributed.",sno
answer,Lorillard's share .,sno
question,Do you -- Do you have any reason to believe that either of those numbers are -- are not accurate?,bin
answer,"No, with the representation that you've made that they arc data that we supplied .",n-d
question,"Sir, I'm -- I'm now showing you what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1249 . This is a-- an exhibit that is a summary of the figures that we have just looked at in Plaintiffs' Exhibit 602A .",sno
answer,Yes .,y
question,"In the top half it lists the total that we saw in the 1954 to 1994 summary for advertising, marketing and promotion, and then below that the total for youth expenditures . See that?",bin-d
answer,Yes .,y
question,"And then below that it performs a mathematical calculation where the percentage of total youth expenditures as a function of total advertising, marketing and promotion is shown .",sno
answer,Yes .,y
question,Do you see that?,bin
answer,Yes .,y
question,". And then in order to put it in a dollar perspective, I've multiplied the pereentaoe by 10,000, giving a figure of youth prevention -- youth 22 prevention expenditure dollar for dollar per thousand dollars of advertising, marketing and promotion for that time period . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do.,y
question,"And when that calculation is made, it shows that for the period 1954 to 1994, for every $10,000 that Lorillard spent on advertising, marketing and promotion of its products, it spent $2 .80 on youth prevention. Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"I'm showing you now what's been marked as Plaintiffs' Exhibit 1250 . It's another summary from Exhibit 602A, this time taking the figures for advertising, marketing, promotion and youth from the dates 1978 through 1994 inclusive, not the entire 40-year span .",sno
answer,I see.,y
question,"Just that summary . And so you have a slightly different total for each one, obviously, because there arc j ust a few of the years included . And then it perfornis the same mathematical calculation at the bottom half of the page . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
answer,Excuse me. I do .,y
question,"Shows that in the time period 1978, which was, as we saw in the earlier exhibit, the year that there was that document that suggested that the base of the Newport business was the high-school age -- Do you recall that document?",bin-d
answer,As being 1978?,nu
question,Yes . You want --,y
answer,"I don't really recall the date, but --",dno
question,You want to take a look it --,bin
answer,"If you represent it, that is fine .",sno
question,"I will represent, and we can get the document and look, but that that document bore the date of 1978 .",sno
answer,All right . All right .,ack
question,"And it shows the expenditures for youth prevention from 1978 to 1994 and for advertising, marketing and promotion for the same time period, and that calculation shows that in that time period, for every $ 10,000 that Lorillard spent on advertising, marketing and promotion, that they spent $3 .30 on youth prevention expenditures . Do you see that?",bin-d
answer,I do .,y
question,"My question to you, sir, is : Does the fact that Lorillard spends only between $2 .80 cents and $3 .30 on youth prevention for evety $10,000 that it spends on advertising show any real commitment to preventing youth from smoking?",bin
answer,"I don't think you can look at this as the measure or certainly the sole measure of commitment, the effectiveness of programs, the feasibility of programs . Of course this -- this is not -- it's -- You'rc isolating Lorillard's expenditure, but it -- it only represent a-- represents a part of the total expenditure through The Tobacco Institute that was going into this activity. And of course you must conceive of effective programs . So totul effectiveness is niore than just the dollars expended. You can spend a lot of dollars and accomplish nothing. So I can't evaluate it strictly on thc basis of dollars as to how effeetive or how appropriate or inappropriate the level of expenditure was .",sno
question,Does it surprise you in any way that -- the -- the disparity between the advertising and the youth prevention budget?,bin
answer,"Does it surprise me? No . I know that the advertising, marketing, promotion budgets directed at smokers is a high level, but it's certainly not directed at non-smokers, and particularly not directed at the youth, so we're talking about two different audiences that we're trying to target here with these expenditures . They're not in competition .",n-d
question,". But as we have seen, whether you intend it or not, the advertising apparently does reach under-age smokers ; correct?",bin-d
answer,"Well I think they certainly see the advertising. Whether it's an influence on them smoking, I don't think so . I think the influence on whether or not they smoke is related to what their peers are doing, principally, and what their parents are doing, as the two principal items, and that's -- those are the things that some of The Tobacco Institute programs have targeted, along with limiting access .",sno
